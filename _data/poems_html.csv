<p class=""line"">The walk up to them was long with fear and shame and rage. </p>

<p class=""line"">And Bean in the warm bed breathing softly and me cold </p>
<p class=""line"">on the floor and writing this poem in an old notebook. </p>
<p class=""line"">And the arrow slit of skylight lets in only a red night. </p>
<p class=""line"">And her Gennady Aygi translations flutter by the bed </p>

<p class=""line"">They pause amid the whiteness, raise their trunks and howl</p>
<p class=""line"">to the absent flesh, circling the bones, picking up each one,</p>
<p class=""line"">putting it down; circling one last time, they stand still in silence</p>
<p class=""line"">for an age, then move. Steps less assured, slower.</p>
<p class=""line"">Why was it so hard to tell my mother, I love you,</p>

<p class=""line"">tracing a woman’s face with a flower?</p>
<p class=""line"">To cling to death, to a metaphor as real as a dying parent,</p>

<p class=""line"">the lamp off. Looking down on a forested town</p>

<p class=""line"">Now is when we love to sit before mirrors</p>
<p class=""line"">with a dark beer or hand out leaflets</p>
<p class=""line"">at chain-link gates or come together after work</p>
<p class=""line"">listening to each other’s hard day. The engine dies,</p>
<p class=""line"">no one hurried to go in. We might</p>
<p class=""line"">walk around in the yard not making a plan.</p>
<p class=""line"">The freeway is heard but there’s no stopping</p>
<p class=""line"">progress, and the week has barely begun. Then</p>
<p class=""line"">we are dressed. It rains. Our heads rest</p>
<p class=""line"">against the elevator wall inhaling a stranger;</p>
<p class=""line"">we think of cliffs we went off</p>
<p class=""line"">with our laughing friends. The faces</p>
<p class=""line"">we put our lips to. Our wonderful sex</p>
<p class=""line"">under whatever we wear. And of the car</p>
<p class=""line"">burning on the side of the highway. Jukeboxes</p>
<p class=""line"">we fed. Quarters circulating with our prints.</p>
<p class=""line"">Things we sent away for. Long drives. The rain. Cafes</p>
<p class=""line"">where we ate late and once only. Eyes of an animal</p>
<p class=""line"">in the headlamps. The guestbooks that verify</p>
<p class=""line"">our whereabouts. Your apple core in the ashtray.</p>
<p class=""line"">The pay toilets where we sat without paper. Rain.</p>
<p class=""line"">Articles left with ex-lovers. The famous</p>
<p class=""line"">ravine of childhood. Movie lines we’ve stood in</p>
<p class=""line"">when it really came down. Moments</p>
<p class=""line"">we have felt forsaken waiting for the others</p>
<p class=""line"">to step from the wrought-iron compartment,</p>
<p class=""line"">or passing through some town with the dial</p>
<p class=""line"">on a Mexican station, wondering for the life of us,</p>
<p class=""line"">where are we going and when would we meet.</p>

<p class=""line"">into the peanut canister </p>
<p class=""line"">of your best friend’s girlfriend’s mom. </p>

<p class=""line"">on which was writ a name not your own. </p>
<p class=""line"">All night it snows a blue snow </p>

Irrevocable Ode,Dean Young,"<p class=""line byline""><em>by <a href=""http://poetry.lib.uidaho.edu/index.php/past-poets/#young"">Dean Young</a></em></p>
<p class=""line"">When you finally admit you’re broken, </p>
<p class=""line"">Can I come back up now? asks the chair </p>
<p class=""line"">with its leg snapped in the basement </p>
<p class=""line"">and Don’t even get me started, says the sky. </p>
<p class=""line"">After a while what always spun can’t </p>
<p class=""line"">without a raw rasp. Exhausted with tears </p>
<p class=""line"">and rage, the couple look at each other, </p>
<p class=""line"">shrug, half a face almost smiling. </p>
<p class=""line"">Smiling the mechanic coming toward us, </p>
<p class=""line"">wiping his greasy hands on a greasier rag, </p>
<p class=""line"">shaking his head. Not no exactly, no </p>
<p class=""line"">inexactly and one year the waxwings </p>
<p class=""line"">don’t appear where they always have. </p>
<p class=""line"">You knock and knock at a door, it won’t </p>
<p class=""line"">open anymore, the paint blisters and peels </p>
<p class=""line"">and that too you’ll learn is beautiful. </p>
<p class=""line"">When Rikyū gave his richest patron </p>
<p class=""line"">a crude clay teapot, it had already </p>
<p class=""line"">been broken twice. The knee never heals </p>
<p class=""line"">and when it rains…. The wife can’t forget </p>
<p class=""line"">what the husband drunkenly raved, </p>
<p class=""line"">the diamond cutter his miscalculations, </p>
<p class=""line"">the contractor thinks if only a few hundred </p>
<p class=""line"">more rivets, just a couple more thou…. </p>
<p class=""line"">If only I hadn’t trusted or trusted </p>
<p class=""line"">sooner, if I hadn’t tried to pass on the hill. </p>
<p class=""line"">Broken vow, broken silence with a coyote’s howl. </p>
<p class=""line"">And you who didn’t get your cat to the vet </p>
<p class=""line"">in time, who dozed, who messed up </p>
<p class=""line"">your sister’s wedding yelling at your mom, </p>
<p class=""line"">who made a friend cry as a joke, jammed </p>
<p class=""line"">the disposal with the antique, pearl-handled </p>
<p class=""line"">spoon, who let someone else take the blame, </p>
<p class=""line"">spiller of red wine on white rugs, </p>
<p class=""line"">breaker of others’ bones, parachuter, </p>
<p class=""line"">big talker, lover of fire, dumb creature </p>
<p class=""line"">of ice, maybe you won’t be forgiven, </p>
<p class=""line"">maybe you’ll never find all your pieces, </p>
<p class=""line"">a new home, maybe you’ll search and petition </p>
<p class=""line"">and wander until you’re heard from no more. </p>

<p class=""line"">We weren’t exactly children again, </p>
<p class=""line"">too many divorces, too many blood panels, </p>
<p class=""line"">but your leaning into me was a sleeping bird. </p>
<p class=""line"">Sure, there was no way to be careful enough, </p>
<p class=""line"">even lightning can go wrong but when the smoke </p>
<p class=""line"">blows off, we can admire the work the fire’s done </p>
<p class=""line"">ironing out the wrinkles in favor of newer ones, </p>
<p class=""line"">ashy furrows like the folds in the brain </p>
<p class=""line"">that signal the switchbacks and reversals </p>
<p class=""line"">of our thought and just as brief. Your lips </p>
<p class=""line"">were song, your hair everywhere. </p>
<p class=""line"">Oh unknowable, fidgeting self, how little </p>
<p class=""line"">bother you were then, no more </p>
<p class=""line"">than a tangerine rind. Oh unknowable </p>

<p class=""line"">It’s not that Monet cared that much about stacks of hay. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Your feelings will never change, you’ll just stop paying so much attention. </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">A whole summer’s songs go by, the whole house turns blue. </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">A friend will need some help carrying boxes to the curb. </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">So slowly you’ll reach into the pond’s reflection of your own face—as if reaching into your face!—the tiny fishes will brush your fingers like nerves made of water. </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Someone else will have to be young enough to climb the scaffolding around the town hall to derange all four of its clock faces. </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">The same laughter will have to work the rest of your life. </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">A friend takes your arm in the woods, it’s darker turning back. </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">You point at an opal in a glass case and the person behind it is only too glad to let you see it against your skin but it’s someone else’s skin you want. </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">You didn’t get everything but you got a lot. </p>

<p class=""line"">the scare, the crow, totems gone, rubies </p>
<p class=""line"">flawed, flamingo in hyena’s jaws, noble </p>
<p class=""line"">and lascivious mouth of the gods hovering </p>
<p class=""line"">then gone, gone the glances, gone moths, </p>
<p class=""line"">cities of crystal become cities of mud, </p>
<p class=""line"">centurion and emperor dust, the flower girl, </p>
<p class=""line"">some of it rises, proof? some of it explodes, </p>
<p class=""line"">vein in the brain, seedpod poof, maybe </p>
<p class=""line"">something will grow, another predicament </p>
<p class=""line"">of bittersweet, dreamfluff milkweed, </p>
<p class=""line"">declarations of aerosols, vows just sprays </p>
<p class=""line"">of spit fast evaporate, all of it pulverized </p>
<p class=""line"">as it hits the seawall, all of it falling snow </p>
<p class=""line"">on water, flash of flying fish, breach and blow </p>
<p class=""line"">and sinking, far below creatures of luminous jelly </p>

The Usual Decision-Making Process,Dean Young,"<p class=""line byline""><em>by <a href=""http://poetry.lib.uidaho.edu/index.php/past-poets/#young"">Dean Young</a></em></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">All day I gather signs: my scars shine, </p>
<p class=""line"">a rope ladder hangs from a bolted window, </p>
<p class=""line"">in the corner store a shimmering robe </p>
<p class=""line"">drapes a headless, hollow monster </p>
<p class=""line"">and I still think of your body. </p>
<p class=""line"">On my table a ladybug searches </p>
<p class=""line"">for someplace to cram herself </p>
<p class=""line"">like a note she didn’t want to know </p>
<p class=""line"">she’d written. It only gets dark </p>
<p class=""line"">half the sky at a time. An hour later, </p>
<p class=""line"">my watch, glowing, hasn’t moved. </p>
<p class=""line"">Earlier, I think, the river showed me </p>
<p class=""line"">places to disappear but it was fooling itself, </p>
<p class=""line"">the river wasn’t going anywhere. Impossible </p>
<p class=""line"">to cut out your own heart but if you do, </p>
<p class=""line"">maybe you’ll grow another. </p>

<p></p>
<p class=""line"">just as you rearranged me so I thought </p>
<p class=""line"">let’s have lunch in a tree, winter already </p>
<p class=""line"">spring, bells to drink champagne from. </p>
<p class=""line"">I couldn’t wait to see you again </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">so tried to warp space-time </p>
<p class=""line"">with sexual energy alone, what a joke, </p>
<p class=""line"">especially over the phone, sorry. </p>
<p class=""line"">Slower the shorter days go, the pool </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">closed a month ago, goldfinches gone </p>

The Land of Nod,James Arthur,"<p class=""line byline""><em>by <a href=""http://poetry.lib.uidaho.edu/index.php/past-poets/#arthur"">James Arthur</a></em></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Growing up, I barely knew the Bible, but read </p>
<p class=""line"">and reread the part when Cain drifted east </p>
<p class=""line"">or was drawn that way, into a place of desolation, </p>
<p class=""line"">the land of Nod, there to begin, with a wife </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">of unknown origin, another race of men, </p>
<p class=""line"">under the mark of God. As a boy, I thought Nod </p>
<p class=""line"">would be a place where the blue scilla </p>
<p class=""line"">would bloom gray, a country of the rack and screw, </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">the serrated sword, where the very serving cups </p>
<p class=""line"">were bone. As a grown man, I’ve heard that Nod </p>
<p class=""line"">never was a nation—of Cain’s offspring, or anyone— </p>
<p class=""line"">but a mistranslation of “wander,” so Cain </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">could go wherever, and be in Nod. Far more </p>
<p class=""line"">than in God, I believe in Cain, who destroyed </p>
<p class=""line"">his own brother, and therefore in any city </p>
<p class=""line"">could have his wish, and be alone. </p>

Bee Sting,Erin Belieu,"<p class=""line byline""><em>by <a href=""http://poetry.lib.uidaho.edu/index.php/past-poets/#belieu"">Erin Belieu</a></em></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">With bees, it isn't the sting itself </p>
<p class=""line"">but the unprovoked attack </p>
<p class=""line"">that lingers. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">How unfair to walk unwary, barefoot </p>
<p class=""line"">on hot concrete, simply </p>
<p class=""line"">pleasuring your feet, </p>
<p class=""line"">or stepping down on a beach towel </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">only to be assaulted by the small plot </p>
<p class=""line"">of something you meant no harm to. </p>
<p class=""line"">That first pain is learned the hard way: </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">at five, you call </p>
<p class=""line""><em>all-y, all-y, all come free</em> </p>
<p class=""line"">singing blind into a hive </p>
<p class=""line"">hidden in the swing-set's pole, then fall </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">what seemed the longest </p>
<p class=""line"">fall; a cloud of bees flowered from your lips. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">And later, put to bed with ice </p>
<p class=""line"">and ointments melting over </p>
<p class=""line"">the welts that covered you, </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">there was no explaining the bees' </p>
<p class=""line"">behavior, no way to comprehend the reason </p>
<p class=""line"">in their rage. You may never understand </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">this: the will behind the stinger, </p>
<p class=""line"">a certain, fatal anger to survive. </p>

<p class=""line"">She never wanted the troll, </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">though, when freeing his beard </p>
<p class=""line"">trapped in the bill of a circling bird, </p>
<p class=""line"">when sliding her scissors through the soft </p>
<p class=""line"">hairs at the nub of his chin, she did </p>
<p class=""line"">think the shadow dropping from the gull's </p>
<p class=""line"">wings lent his face a certain ugly interest. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">She never wanted the prince's brother, </p>

<p></p>
<p class=""line"">second prize to the elder, but just as vain, </p>
<p class=""line"">with a woman's soft hips and hands, </p>
<p class=""line"">surrounding himself with mirrors and liking </p>
<p class=""line"">her sister better anyway, her indiscriminate </p>
<p class=""line"">sweetness; an ordinary fruit ripening </p>
<p class=""line"">in a bowl displayed on a public table. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">And she did not want the bear </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">their mother invited next to the fire, </p>
<p class=""line"">though his stinking fur could make </p>
<p class=""line"">her eyes and mouth water. Once, she devised </p>
<p class=""line"">a way to lie beside him, innocently </p>
<p class=""line"">at first, then not so, curled behind him, </p>
<p class=""line"">running her thumbnail down his spine. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">What she wanted, of course, was her own place in the forest, </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">where she would take the flowering trees </p>
<p class=""line"">that grew outside her mother's bedroom windowone </p>
<p class=""line"">white, buxom with albino blossoms, </p>
<p class=""line"">one red, smaller, with delicate, hooked thorns - </p>
<p class=""line"">and plant them on opposite sides of her cottage, </p>
<p class=""line"">watching each bloom fall as summer spoiled them. </p>

<p></p>
<p class=""line"">The single expensive vase, its tulip face now </p>

<p></p>
<p class=""line"">how, busy getting born, still wings and green </p>

<p></p>
<p class=""line"">and die. Violets grow on one curled leg, </p>
<p class=""line"">a slender prop obliviously crushed, </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">and newborn birds are falling from their eggs, </p>
<p class=""line"">still feathered wet and hidden in the brush </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">when you walk by. They die in spite of us; </p>
<p class=""line"">in shoebox nests and jelly jars supplied </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">with best intentions. Bring them in the house, </p>
<p class=""line"">then fuss, arrange things, feed them. Occupy </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">yourself with worms and eyedroppers, sunlight </p>
<p class=""line"">and potting earth. You'll bury them in days, </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">feel silly in your grief. And still you'll sit </p>
<p class=""line"">a moment on the blacktop, study ways </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">to save an unimportant, pretty weed </p>
<p class=""line"">or bird. You're still a fool --a fool to bend </p>

<p class=""line"">most notably by Larry who found my snood</p>
<p class=""line"">unsuitable, another time by Jack,</p>

<p class=""line"">squirting perfume onto little cards,</p>

<p class=""line"">covers from romance novels, their heroines</p>
<p class=""line"">slaving on the chain gang of obsessive love—</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">and always the same hard candy </p>
<p class=""line"">of shame dissolving in my throat;</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">handing in my apron, returning the cash-</p>
<p class=""line"">register key. And yet, how fine it feels,</p>
<p class=""line"">the perversity of freedom which never signs</p>
<p class=""line"">a rent check or explains anything to one’s family.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">I’ve arrived again, taking one more last</p>
<p class=""line"">walk through another door, thinking “<em>I</em> am </p>

<p class=""line"">Edition, they’d rather fight with each roll </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">over New York and Boardwalk, Railroads </p>
<p class=""line"">and Utilities. He’s yet to own Boardwalk, </p>

<p class=""line"">Occasionally, he is lucky to land in jail, </p>

<p class=""line"">to pay rent. She buys hotels early, casts </p>

<p class=""line"">shrugged, hat tipped. The man winked at a stack </p>

<p class=""line"">of pastels tucked under her edge of town.</p>
<p class=""line"">The game was fixed. She kept drawing </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">the good cards from Community Chest</p>
<p class=""line"">and Chance. Her husband lived in the suburbs </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">and she was his landlord. Like his father, </p>
<p class=""line"">he slipped off and got drunk on Boardwalk, </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">gallivanted for a while. It cost him everything—</p>
<p class=""line"">she owned that, too. Fed up, he took out a loan </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">at 10 percent interest, paid her and passed Go,</p>
<p class=""line"">collected two hundred dollars and made a run for it. </p>

<p class=""indentedline"">the iron bridge, </p>
<p class=""line"">and your favorite, the county dump, where you found the stove Grandmother </p>
<p class=""indentedline"">cooks supper on today. </p>
<p class=""line"">Except for that back left eye, the thing works fine. I helped you clean it. </p>
<p class=""indentedline"">We meet Cecil </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">at the coffee shop, where he pulls mints from his pocket—he thinks </p>
<p class=""indentedline"">they go </p>
<p class=""line"">with everything, and you let me know quick that coffee is good with nothing else </p>
<p class=""indentedline"">but coffee, </p>
<p class=""line"">yet behind your back, I’ve been stirring in cream and sugar for years. </p>
<p class=""indentedline"">I don’t drive a pickup </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">like you did, but I’ll take the gravel roads to the bridge where you </p>
<p class=""indentedline"">jumped </p>
<p class=""line"">from the top as a boy, and when I’d ask if I could jump, you’d say no. </p>
<p class=""indentedline"">I understand now, </p>
<p class=""line"">but since you died, I’ve leapt several times into that snake-infested water. </p>
<p class=""indentedline"">The current </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">took hold of me one time and sent me nearly a mile from the bridge. </p>
<p class=""indentedline"">But I’m dry now, </p>
<p class=""line"">and Ole Maude’s waiting. Nothing beats a couple of Swisher Sweets </p>
<p class=""indentedline"">to give you cancer </p>
<p class=""line"">and a Chevy Luv to send you to the dump. Plundering’s harder than it looks. </p>
<p class=""indentedline"">Just because I’ve grown </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">two feet since the last time we’ve come out here doesn’t mean I can see it any better. </p>
<p class=""indentedline"">The smell is worse </p>
<p class=""line"">and the caffeine doesn’t hold as long. So I pop a mint in my mouth and breathe </p>
<p class=""indentedline"">in the stench anyway, </p>
<p class=""line"">but I don’t find a stove or anything like it, just junk, piled up and buried, </p>
<p class=""indentedline"">from someone else’s memory.</p>

<p class=""line"">my brother’s leg destroyed after detonation; </p>

<p class=""line"">I’ve seen the different phases of training—crawl, </p>

<p class=""line"">and marked, with flags, the safe zone; </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">and I’ve walked through such a minefield. </p>
<p class=""line"">I’ve witnessed the Volcano, a machine, scatter </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">960 antitank mines </p>
<p class=""line"">over one kilometer of sand, but never have I </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">seen the battle, or the desert, or those mines, or <span style=""font-size:larger"">TOC</span> </p>
<p class=""line"">calling a precision-bombing air strike across the line. </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">I’ve dismantled many mines, winnowed Russian mines </p>
<p class=""line"">from French mines, but I’ve never seen the mines </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">on television; I’ve known soldiers who have seen </p>
<p class=""line"">those mines; soldiers caught under fire, blasting cap </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">clenched in the mouth, jaw gone missing; </p>
<p class=""line"">and that must be what it means to see the desert: </p>

<p class=""line"">the man must feel at home: </p>
<p class=""line"">ordered, pressed, complete. </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">That is the point of a uniform— </p>

<p class=""line"">to salute the brass properly </p>
<p class=""line"">without a wrinkle showing. </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">And what of the sewer grate </p>
<p class=""line"">that catches in a soldier’s mind— </p>
<p class=""line"">bolt and chamber—spark </p>
<p class=""line"">pouring from a fresh M16 </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">in fresh hands with fresh ideals, </p>
<p class=""line"">firing bullets down a range </p>
<p class=""line"">of plastic pop-up targets </p>
<p class=""line"">that fall facedown in dirt </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">with each hit, only to spring </p>
<p class=""line"">back to the way they were? </p>
<p class=""line"">After a day of shooting, </p>
<p class=""line"">the maggots chant: <em>Blood</em> </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line""><em>makes the green grass grow,</em> </p>

Death,Kwame Dawes,"<p class=""line byline""><em>by <a href=""http://poetry.lib.uidaho.edu/index.php/category/kwame-dawes/"">Kwame Dawes</a></em></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">First your dog dies and you pray </p>
<p class=""line"">for the Holy Spirit to raise the inept </p>
<p class=""line"">lump in the sack, but Jesus’s name </p>
<p class=""line"">is no magic charm; sunsets and the </p>
<p class=""line"">flies are gathering. That is how faith </p>
<p class=""line"">dies. By dawn you know death, </p>
<p class=""line"">the way it arrives and then grows </p>
<p class=""line"">silent. Death wins. So you walk </p>
<p class=""line"">out to the tangle of thorny weeds behind </p>
<p class=""line"">the barn, and you coax a black </p>
<p class=""line"">cat to your fingers. You let it lick </p>
<p class=""line"">milk and spit from your hand before </p>
<p class=""line"">you squeeze its neck until it messes </p>
<p class=""line"">itself, its claws tearing your skin, </p>
<p class=""line"">its eyes growing into saucers. </p>
<p class=""line"">A dead cat is light as a live </p>
<p class=""line"">one and not stiff, not yet. You </p>
<p class=""line"">grab its tail and fling it as </p>
<p class=""line"">far as you can. The crows find </p>
<p class=""line"">it first; by then the stench </p>
<p class=""line"">of the hog pens hides the canker </p>
<p class=""line"">of death. Now you know the power </p>
<p class=""line"">of death, that you have it, </p>
<p class=""line"">that you can take life in a second </p>
<p class=""line"">and wake the same the next day. </p>
<p class=""line"">This is why you can’t fear death. </p>
<p class=""line"">You have seen the broken neck </p>
<p class=""line"">of a man in a well, you know who </p>
<p class=""line"">pushed him over the lip of the well, </p>
<p class=""line"">tumbling down; you know all about </p>
<p class=""line"">blood on the ground. You know that </p>
<p class=""line"">a dead dog is a dead cat is a dead </p>
<p class=""line"">man. Now you look a white man </p>
<p class=""line"">in the face, talk to him about </p>
<p class=""line"">cotton prices and the cost of land, </p>
<p class=""line"">laugh your wide openmouthed laugh </p>
<p class=""line"">in his face, and he knows one thing </p>
<p class=""line"">about you: that you know the power </p>
<p class=""line"">of death, and you will die as easily </p>
<p class=""line"">as live. This is how a man seizes </p>
<p class=""line"">what he wants, how a man </p>
<p class=""line"">turns the world over in dreams, </p>
<p class=""line"">eats a solid meal and waits </p>
<p class=""line"">for death to come like nothing, </p>
<p class=""line"">like the open sky, like light </p>
<p class=""line"">at early morning. Like a man </p>
<p class=""line"">in red pinstriped trousers, a black </p>
<p class=""line"">top hat, a yellow scarf, </p>
<p class=""line"">and a kerchief dipped in eau </p>
<p class=""line"">de cologne to cut through </p>
<p class=""line"">the stench coming from his mouth. </p>

<p class=""line"">or would you carry me off somewhere? </p>
<p class=""line"">Do you think about problems </p>

<p class=""line"">my Lifeline is not on the palm of my hand, </p>

<p class=""line"">it’s my leg lifted over my man’s body. </p>
<p class=""line"">How natural it is for a Lifeline </p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Between the shots, in her mind’s eye </p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">On the beach </p>
<p class=""line"">the watermelon fortress </p>

<p class=""line"">against us </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

<p class=""line"">over backwards—the same </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">sensation rips me out of sleep—in other </p>
<p class=""line"">words, far too beautiful to bear. </p>
<p class=""line"">A passenger recurs, always </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">in a different seat, and won’t adhere </p>
<p class=""line"">to my schedule, but I am too </p>
<p class=""line"">weak to ask whether </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">we’re running ahead or behind. Who would </p>
<p class=""line"">know. When I melt this way I relish </p>
<p class=""line"">the cool air forcing </p>

<p class=""line"">are gone now; we never held them</p>
<p class=""line"">very tightly, but what our wounds lack</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">in depth, they make up for in breadth.</p>
<p class=""line"">If living is a sort of punishment or reward,</p>
<p class=""line"">well there’s no way I can finish </p>
<p></p>

<p class=""line"">to show you how many years </p>
<p class=""line"">with my fingers. The only thing worse</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">than advice is an opinion. This paper</p>
<p class=""line"">bag is full of them, and a lone </p>
<p class=""line"">hydraulic squeal is telling me </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">it’s garbage night. The moon agrees, </p>

<p class=""line"">A protein mesh was my mother, </p>
<p class=""line"">and the zipper teeth of my DNA </p>

<p></p>
<p></p>

<p class=""line"">they plucked one out and carried it off </p>
<p class=""line"">for a stranger with defective marrow. </p>
<p class=""line"">“This won’t hurt,” they said. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">I filled the space in anyhow. </p>
<p class=""line"">I grew, I got the trick of breathing, </p>
<p class=""line"">fed from an IV. </p>
<p class=""line"">Learned to drink from a bottle. </p>
<p class=""line"">Who knows if my origins explain </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">my fear of needles, my cravings for salty food, </p>
<p class=""line"">enclosed warm spaces, pale young men with leukemia. </p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Aunt Lydia has worked out this much </p>
<p class=""line"">since Cousin Bobby told her about a comma </p>
<p class=""line"">he skipped long ago while learning his catechism. </p>
<p class=""line"">Now, on a rainy morning, spared the news </p>
<p class=""line"">that lay in her grass and is too wet to read, </p>
<p class=""line"">she’s flexed her stiff hands and found them able </p>
<p class=""line"">to slice the bread baked by a friend </p>
<p class=""line"">and twist the lid from a royal-red jar, </p>
<p class=""line"">and with the first crusty, raspberry bite </p>
<p class=""line"">she’s ready to affirm God does make jam. </p>
<p class=""line"">It still counts if people figure among </p>
<p class=""line"">the instruments that have been put to use, </p>
<p class=""line"">and Bobby catechized wasn’t wrong </p>

<p class=""line"">A soft sweet cheese they make for daily bread, </p>
<p class=""line"">and in the vat of milk and rennet set an egg, </p>
<p class=""line"">to tell them when it’s done. While they’re </p>
<p class=""line"">feeding the chickens or sowing corn, the whey </p>
<p class=""line"">congeals in streaks and superstring curls. </p>
<p class=""line"">Rifts develop, curdy lumps, </p>
<p class=""line"">and gases congregate in spirals; </p>
<p class=""line"">the smell grows desirably rank as elements </p>
<p class=""line"">thicken into earths and metals, </p>
<p class=""line"">and when our unhatched robin-blue planet </p>
<p class=""line"">sinks, this batch will be ready. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Or maybe enough dark matter exists </p>

<p class=""line"">a dark dark marbled Swiss with black holes </p>
<p class=""line"">and delicious veins of stardust forming </p>
<p class=""line"">from windborne impurities, along one of which </p>
<p class=""line"">our Earth is a fleck of blue mold. </p>

<p class=""line"">His gifts to her were theory, patience, </p>
<p class=""line"">equilibrium, and a pile of dirt— </p>
<p class=""line"">industrial waste. He loved to watch his wife </p>
<p class=""line"">aglow with determination, pursuing </p>
<p class=""line"">discovery of a hidden element, past uranium, </p>
<p class=""line"">by the light of her hunger. “I should </p>
<p class=""line"">like it to have a beautiful color,” he said. </p>
<p class=""line"">He would buy her boots to wipe at the Sorbonne. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Heated, she leaned over a boiling vat, </p>
<p class=""line"">stirring her dirt reduction, hour on hour. </p>
<p class=""line"">She looked like any skinny hausfrau </p>

<p class=""line"">the first to fall to her knees before </p>
<p class=""line"">a hill of brown dust shot through with pine needles </p>
<p class=""line"">and press her filled hands to her face. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">She boiled her tons of pitchblende down </p>
<p class=""line"">to a scraping of radium nearly the size </p>
<p class=""line"">of their baby’s smallest fingernail—just the white. </p>
<p class=""line"">Proof of its existence, and hers. </p>
<p class=""line"">It permeated their clothes, their papers, </p>
<p class=""line"">peeled their fingers, </p>
<p class=""line"">entered their marrow and slowly burned. </p>
<p class=""line"">He mildly alluded to rheumatism. </p>
<p class=""line"">He stroked her radioactive hair </p>
<p class=""line"">with a radioactive hand. </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Colorless, shining radium darkened </p>
<p class=""line"">in contact with air. Chemically </p>
<p class=""line"">much like calcium, it could stream </p>
<p class=""line"">like calcium through her brain cells </p>
<p class=""line"">in her later years alone </p>
<p class=""line"">and make memories glow in the dark: </p>
<p class=""line"">illegal schooling, unheated rooms, </p>
<p class=""line"">subsistence on tea and chocolate. Lying </p>
<p class=""line"">with her husband for a few hours’ sleep, </p>
<p class=""line"">cracked hands and weakened legs entwined, </p>
<p class=""line"">united gaze resting on the vial </p>
<p class=""line"">of radium salts they kept beside them every night </p>

<p class=""line"">pale slender stalks with drooping lids. </p>
<p class=""line"">They scarcely had weight when I laid them in my mouth </p>

<p class=""line"">a pure burnt mineral black, absorbing </p>
<p class=""line"">every available grain of light </p>
<p class=""line"">and falling apart like charcoal at a touch. </p>
<p class=""line"">I ate it, since it fed on me, </p>
<p class=""line"">and yet I lost ground. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Where I used to live, rings of gilled umbrellas </p>
<p class=""line"">materialized in the grass wherever they chose. </p>
<p class=""line"">So, shrunken in my bandages, hollow-legged, </p>
<p class=""line"">I pace wet gutters in daylight traffic, </p>
<p class=""line"">holding my remnants wide to the breeze </p>
<p class=""line"">for any spores that will have me. </p>

<p class=""line"">They sing, they soar, the whales of our time, </p>
<p class=""line"">whales of the tropical shallows, the streams </p>
<p class=""line"">and rivers, the courtyard ponds. </p>
<p class=""line"">Stone records say there were giants in the seas, </p>
<p class=""line"">but grudgingly supported, and no more. </p>
<p class=""line"">Much as the mouse outlived the titanothere, </p>
<p class=""line"">tiny whales and whales the size of chickens </p>
<p class=""line"">perch on white twigs of coral, pipe shrill melodies, </p>
<p class=""line"">pluck up tube worms from cracks </p>
<p class=""line"">with one neat turn of the head, </p>
<p class=""line"">or flit through cloudy fathoms </p>
<p class=""line"">snagging luminous particles one by one. </p>
<p class=""line"">Much as lizards in shabby plumage </p>
<p class=""line"">filled a kingdom bereft of tyrannosaurs, </p>
<p class=""line"">these timid, swift creatures have sprouted </p>
<p class=""line"">a specialized fur like penguin feathers: </p>
<p class=""line"">most are brown or gray, but some wear </p>
<p class=""line"">iridescent amethyst, ruby, silver, trailing </p>
<p class=""line"">scarves and plumes of musical bubbles. </p>
<p class=""line"">Little Sargassos of sodden down </p>
<p class=""line"">form in their molting seasons. </p>
<p class=""line"">You can keep in your basement aquarium an echo </p>
<p class=""line"">of beasts large enough to be taken for islands, </p>
<p class=""line"">to snap the ribs of a ship, to swallow </p>
<p class=""line"">a man and vomit up his implausible story. </p>
<p class=""line"">You can ply with cracker crumbs a puff </p>
<p class=""line"">whose ancestor, Leviathan, </p>
<p class=""line"">divided the surface with its brow </p>
<p class=""line"">while its open jaw scraped the ocean floor. </p>
<p class=""line"">You may cup a whale briefly in your palm, </p>
<p class=""line"">stroke its back with one finger, </p>
<p class=""line"">feel its heart beating like wings, and marvel: </p>
<p class=""line"">oh the precious, the comprehensible world. </p>

<p class=""line"">Elizabeth Bishop leaned on a table, it cracked, </p>
<p class=""line"">both fell to the floor. A gesture </p>
<p class=""line"">gone sadly awry. This was close to fact </p>
<p class=""line"">and quickly became symbolic, bound to occur </p>
<p class=""line"">in Florida, where she was surrounded </p>
<p class=""line"">by rotting abundance and greedy insects. </p>
<p class=""line"">One moment a laughing smile, a graceful hand </p>
<p class=""line"">alighting on solid furniture, </p>
<p class=""line"">a casual shift of weight, </p>
<p class=""line"">the next, undignified splayed legs. </p>
<p class=""line"">The shell of the table </p>
<p class=""line"">proved to be stuffed with termite eggs. </p>
<p class=""line"">True, it was a fall from no great height— </p>
<p class=""line"">merely the height of herself, </p>
<p class=""line"">and although the hollowed-out table failed, </p>
<p class=""line"">at least the floor held, </p>
<p class=""line"">though probably infested by termites as well, </p>
<p class=""line"">and possibly built on a latent sinkhole‚ </p>
<p class=""line"">how can you tell? </p>
<p class=""line"">And how could she, smiling and easy, </p>
<p class=""line"">arm moving without forethought and permission, </p>
<p class=""line"">have forgotten fear, apparently </p>
<p class=""line"">let go of a hard-learned lesson? </p>
<p class=""line italic"">Enter a room as though it is strange. </p>
<p class=""line italic"">What you recognize may have changed, </p>
<p class=""line italic"">or may change without warning. </p>
<p class=""line italic"">Trees fall in hurricanes </p>
<p class=""line italic"">and on windless mornings, </p>
<p class=""line italic"">breaching houses where people you knew </p>
<p class=""line italic"">have vanished or died or stopped loving you. </p>
<p class=""line"">She regained her feet, already composed, </p>
<p class=""line"">brushing dust from an elbow. There would be a bruise, </p>
<p class=""line"">but it would remind her that <em>words are full of holes;</em> </p>
<p class=""line italic"">flung hard, like paper they fly sideways. </p>
<p class=""line italic"">And a call to joy—a landscape, a face— </p>
<p class=""line italic"">may, though scarcely moving, perhaps by not moving, go </p>
<p class=""line italic"">in one breath from heartening to ominous, </p>
<p class=""line italic"">proving to children who need more proof </p>
<p class=""line italic"">that we don’t know what we know. </p>

<p></p>
<p class=""line"">And then, the clawed feet of something</p>
<p class=""line"">akin to speech crawling across the half-moon</p>
<p class=""line"">of my lip. I, red-beetled and buzzed, come</p>
<p class=""line"">crawling into bed tonight looking for the last</p>
<p class=""line"">light of this evening’s rage in your hair. God,</p>
<p class=""line"">how long the night trapped in the bottom</p>
<p class=""line"">of a bottle thrown into a sewer or lodged</p>
<p class=""line"">in a man’s dark hand? I am still holding the bird</p>
<p class=""line"">I wrestled from the streetlamp of your anger.</p>
<p class=""line"">It is pecking at my palm. I cover its mouth </p>
<p class=""line"">and the avalanche in its throat when I come </p>
<p class=""line"">into the house so as not to wake you.</p>
<p class=""line"">The fountain, in the square, is still broken.</p>
<p class=""line"">It leaks like a man. I’ve said this before: I come</p>
<p class=""line"">as the children came before the closed door</p>
<p class=""line"">of Noah’s ark: to plead for water. To beg you stay.</p>

<p class=""line"">and pluck the flower from the fire, </p>

<p class=""line"">A foot chalking a valley black and bright beneath</p>

<p class=""line"">of a rhododendron bush. Yes, the heart yearns for such failing.</p>
<p class=""line"">Will you allow it to fail? It is failing anyway, with </p>

<p class=""line"">To the same baffled heart I have always carried.</p>
<p class=""line"">The diamonds and mud of my mouth. The midsummer </p>
<p class=""line"">Lurching toward the late-summer heat that will kill</p>
<p class=""line"">The sage and tomato plants tanning on the veranda. </p>
<p class=""line"">I want the water and the leg my uncle lost coming from the well.</p>
<p class=""line"">If one body will hide another and call this hiding love,</p>
<p class=""line"">I want to always torture myself with another’s wet borders.</p>
<p class=""line"">An ankle clicking against an ankle. The wrists fettered. </p>
<p class=""line"">There was something I knew before this. Before my hands</p>
<p class=""line"">Tore at the ropes, snapped cedar poles and ripped the silk </p>
<p class=""line"">Of any tent I lay in. I want to know how the savage</p>
<p class=""line"">Wind loves the house it destroys. I want to know before</p>
<p class=""line"">I am both house and savage wind, before all of the tents </p>
<p class=""line"">In the city become tattered rags snagged in the hair</p>
<p class=""line"">Of our children and the redheaded trees. I am careful</p>
<p class=""line"">To want nothing that I cannot lose and be sad in the losing.</p>
<p class=""line"">A terrace made of rotting bamboo. A harp lost in its singing. </p>
<p class=""line"">My last name and the tomatoes falling from the vine. Woman,</p>
<p class=""line"">I want this plum heart. And the dying that makes us possible.</p>

Against Its Own Ringing,Roger Reeves,"<p class=""line byline""><em>by <a href=""http://poetry.lib.uidaho.edu/index.php/past-poets/#reeves"">Roger Reeves</a></em></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">More than once I’ve asked a body to scatter</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line em6"">And have received that scattering.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">More than once, a scar. More than once a scare-</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line em6"">Crow watching the corn of another’s body</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Sing and break beneath my marble eyes, my exhausted feet.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line em6"">More than once, I’ve been a bell broken</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Against its own ringing. A kind of meadow unified</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line em6"">By the barest imagination broken.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Even if I could take the diamonds down from your hair,</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line em6"">Unsnack the woolen snood of desire</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Worn about your head like a broken chandelier, winter</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line em6"">Leers at us from this spring’s browning</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Timothy, the deer tangled in the tines of a barbwire fence.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line em6"">The children in the creek mis-practicing</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">The baptizing of John, his head held below the water</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line em6"">Until a crown of metallic fish gather about it. How else </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Shall ruin announce itself if not in one body touching another?</p>

<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Look, the wind’s causing the corn to chatter.</p>
<p class=""line"">A mule slips through the gossip like a tongue.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Once, I let a ghost ride me over a row of pews</p>
<p class=""line"">as a harvest wagon rides a mule. Once, I was </p>
<p class=""line"">a soft tongue pressed against your collarbone. </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">It broke. And there was no honey inside the house.</p>
<p class=""line"">And Indian summer had finally quit,</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">committing suicide in the stream out back.</p>
<p class=""line"">But let’s forget the three-legged foal I shot,</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">out behind the barn. Listen to the corn</p>
<p class=""line"">husk scuttling along the road in this fog.</p>
<p class=""line"">Pretend this is the first time you’ve seen me</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">reach into the hollow of a tree and snap a comb</p>
<p class=""line"">of honey from a hive. Let’s pretend it doesn’t sting.</p>

<p class=""line"">for a second seemed to be in a mostly nice way </p>

<p class=""line"">wearing dishwashing gloves a blue </p>
<p class=""line"">color not found in nature </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">in order to find the little brown body </p>

<p></p>
<p class=""line"">horrifying me and stand in the doorway </p>
<p class=""line"">and hold it out in front of me </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">to the wind which even if everywhere else </p>
<p class=""line"">in the city it is calm </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">rushes down our street </p>
<p class=""line"">where the yellow Kawasaki is always </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">parked next to the green bin </p>
<p class=""line"">I threw the candles we can’t light anymore </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">into because their wicks are gone </p>
<p class=""line"">and you cried because </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">I had thrown out the beautiful candles </p>
<p class=""line"">the sun turns in a different direction </p>

<p class=""line"">in one of those giant incredibly brightly lit stores </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">you can apparently see from space </p>

<p></p>
<p class=""line"">of the giant failure </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">known as high school again </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">on the loudspeaker was a familiar song </p>

<p></p>
<p class=""line"">there were no lyrics but I remember </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">it says we are all skyscrapers </p>

<p class=""line"">under one blue rectangle </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">that never chose us </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">to be these sentinels </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">who imperceptibly sway </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">and watch people far below </p>

<p class=""line"">like tiny devices no one controls </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">enter our various sunlit glass conversations </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">the world is old </p>

<p></p>
<p class=""line"">of commerce and its hopeful nonprofit mitigations </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">future products from the Amazon </p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p class=""line"">and also ones not yet invented </p>

<p class=""line"">four flashlights and a pink plastic water bottle </p>

What Can Poetry Do,Matthew Zapruder,"<p class=""line byline""><em>by <a href=""http://poetry.lib.uidaho.edu/index.php/past-poets/#zapruder"">Matthew Zapruder</a></em></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">In Africa people are angry. </p>
<p class=""line"">They are climbing embassy walls </p>
<p class=""line"">and burning whatever is there. </p>
<p class=""line"">Each time I click on some words </p>
<p class=""line"">and read what we call news </p>
<p class=""line"">I feel certain some people </p>
<p class=""line"">while I was reading have died. </p>
<p class=""line"">I know I am here merely reading. </p>
<p class=""line"">I just sit in my room and worry. </p>
<p class=""line"">As always I can do nothing. </p>
<p class=""line"">So I close all the portals and go </p>
<p class=""line"">deep in my mind to discover </p>
<p class=""line"">something about Tunisia. </p>
<p class=""line"">Tunisia of desert silence </p>
<p class=""line"">broken by occasional battles </p>
<p class=""line"">where a man set himself on fire </p>
<p class=""line"">then revolution then elections. </p>
<p class=""line"">Tunisia whose cosmopolitan </p>
<p class=""line"">capital city Carthage </p>
<p class=""line"">the Romans completely destroyed. </p>
<p class=""line"">Tunisia where they filmed </p>
<p class=""line"">the familiar home planet scenes </p>
<p class=""line"">of the space movie we all stood in line </p>
<p class=""line"">a million years ago to see. </p>
<p class=""line"">I don’t know anything else. </p>
<p class=""line"">Now I remember something </p>
<p class=""line"">I once read about the forests </p>
<p class=""line"">people are carefully growing </p>
<p class=""line"">far from the capital city. </p>
<p class=""line"">The trees are eating the poison </p>
<p class=""line"">probably much too slowly. </p>
<p class=""line"">But still they take the particles </p>
<p class=""line"">and even if we don’t deserve it </p>
<p class=""line"">our air is a little clearer. </p>
<p class=""line"">It’s like the painting I saw </p>
<p class=""line"">of a witch in the forest </p>
<p class=""line"">her hair in a black column rising </p>
<p class=""line"">like smoke from a burning structure. </p>
<p class=""line"">She was dragging three or four ropes </p>
<p class=""line"">the color of umbilical blood. </p>
<p class=""line"">She was guarded by her wolf familiar. </p>
<p class=""line"">At first she terrified me. </p>
<p class=""line"">Then I saw she was causing </p>
<p class=""line"">certain spells to protect </p>
<p class=""line"">far away new mothers </p>
<p class=""line"">whose children must in the middle </p>
<p class=""line"">of great violence be born. </p>
<p class=""line"">The men surround the embassy. </p>
<p class=""line"">It will never be clear who sent them. </p>
<p class=""line"">For a moment I feel ashamed. </p>
<p class=""line"">I breathe the clear terrible air. </p>

<p class=""line"">seems happier or at least its petals a little whiter </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">when it is placed right up against the window </p>

<p class=""line"">or how certain invisible particles </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">leave the wall and enter the cord and somehow make </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">the radio make the air become </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Moonlight Sonata or Neighborhood #3 </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">basically a lamp is a mechanism </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">to shove too many electrons into a coil </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">or filament a lightbulb i.e. a vacuum surrounds </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">the first filament was made in 1802 out of platinum </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">as soon as it was made to turn deep untouchable orange </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">the air took the electrons away </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">which left it charred like a tiny bonfire </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">just like ones we have all seen when we squint and hold </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">the glass bulb that no longer emits </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">soft white light when we flip the switch </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">I wonder if my fear this morning sitting in the dark </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">and listening to music is anything like </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">the inventor of the telephone growing deaf </p>
<p></p>

<p class=""line"">Betsy Ross needled hot stars to Mr. Washington’s bedspread— </p>
<p class=""line em2"">they weren’t hers to give. So, when the cavalry came, </p>
<p class=""line em4"">we ate their horses. Then, unfortunately, our bellies were filled </p>
<p class=""line em6"">with bullet holes. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Pack the suitcases with white cans of corned beef— </p>
<p class=""line em2"">when we leave, our hunger will go with us, </p>
<p class=""line em4"">following behind, a dog with ribs like a harp. </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Blue gourds glow and rattle like a two-man band: </p>
<p class=""line em2"">Hotchkiss on backup vocals and Gatling on drums. </p>
<p class=""line em4"">The rhythm is set by our boys dancing the warpath— </p>
<p class=""line em6"">the meth 3-step. Grandmothers dance their legs off— </p>
<p class=""line em8"">who now will teach us to stand? </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">We carry dimming lamps like god cages— </p>
<p class=""line em2"">they help us to see that it is dark. In the dark our hands </p>
<p class=""line em4"">pretend to pray but really make love. </p>
<p class=""line em6"">Soon we’ll give birth to fists—they’ll open up </p>
<p class=""line em8"">black eyes and split grins—we’ll all cry out. </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">History has chapped lips, unkissable lips— </p>
<p class=""line em2"">he gave me a coral necklace that shines bright as a chokehold. </p>
<p class=""line em4"">He gives and gives—census names given to Mojaves: </p>
<p class=""line em6"">George and Martha Washington, Abraham Lincoln, </p>
<p class=""line em8"">Robin Hood, Rip Van Winkle. </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Loot bag ghosts float fatly in dark museum corners— </p>
<p class=""line em2"">I see my grandfather’s flutes and rabbit sticks in their guts. </p>
<p class=""line em4"">About the beautiful dresses emptied of breasts… </p>
<p class=""line em6"">they were nothing compared to the emptied bodies. </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Splintering cradleboards sing bone lullabies— </p>
<p class=""line em2"">they hush the mention of half-breed babies buried or left on riverbanks. </p>
<p class=""line em4"">When you ask about officers who chased our screaming women </p>
<p class=""line em6"">into the arrowweeds, they only hum. </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">A tongue will wrestle its mouth to death and lose— </p>
<p class=""line em2"">language is a cemetery. </p>
<p class=""line em4"">Tribal dentists light lab-coat pyres in memoriam of lost molars— </p>
<p class=""line em6"">our cavities are larger than HUD houses. </p>
<p class=""line em8"">Some Indians’ wisdom teeth never stop growing back in— </p>

I Watch Her Eat the Apple,Natalie Diaz,"<p class=""line byline""><em>by <a href=""http://poetry.lib.uidaho.edu/index.php/past-poets/#diaz"">Natalie Diaz</a></em></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">She twirls it in her left hand, </p>
<p class=""line"">a small red merry-go-round. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">According to the white oval sticker, </p>
<p class=""line"">she holds apple #4016. </p>
<p class=""line"">I’ve read in some book or other </p>
<p class=""line"">of four thousand fifteen fruits she held </p>
<p class=""line"">before this one, each equally dizzied </p>
<p class=""line"">by the heat in the tips of her fingers. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">She twists the stem, pulls it </p>
<p class=""line"">like the pin of a grenade, and I just know </p>
<p class=""line"">somewhere someone is sitting alone on a porch, </p>
<p class=""line"">bruised, opened up to their wet white ribs, </p>
<p class=""line"">riddled by her teeth— </p>
<p class=""line"">lucky. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">With her right hand, she lifts the sticker </p>
<p class=""line"">from the skin. Now, </p>
<p class=""line"">the apple is more naked than any apple has been </p>
<p class=""line"">since two bodies first touched the leaves </p>
<p class=""line"">of ache in the garden. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Maybe her apple is McIntosh, maybe Red Delicious. </p>
<p class=""line"">I only know it is the color of something I dreamed, </p>
<p class=""line"">some thing I gave to her after being away </p>
<p class=""line"">for ten thousand nights. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">The apple pulses like a red bird in her hand— </p>
<p class=""line"">she is setting the red bird free, </p>
<p class=""line"">but the red bird will not go, </p>
<p class=""line"">so she pulls it to her face as if to tell it a secret. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">She bites, cleaving away a red wing. </p>
<p class=""line"">The red bird sings. Yes, </p>
<p class=""line"">she bites the apple and there is music— </p>
<p class=""line"">a branch breaking, a ship undone by the shore, </p>
<p class=""line"">a knife making love to a wound, the sweet scrape </p>
<p class=""line"">of a match lighting the lamp of her mouth. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">This blue world has never needed a woman </p>
<p class=""line"">to eat an apple so badly, to destroy an apple, </p>
<p class=""line"">to make the apple bone— </p>
<p class=""line"">and she does it. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">I watch her eat the apple, </p>
<p class=""line"">carve it to the core, and set it, wobbling, </p>
<p class=""line"">on the table— </p>
<p class=""line"">a broken bell I beg to wrap my red skin around </p>
<p class=""line"">until there is no apple, </p>
<p class=""line"">there is only this woman </p>
<p class=""line"">who is a city of apples, </p>
<p class=""line"">there is only me licking the juice </p>
<p class=""line"">from the streets of her palm. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">If there is a god of fruit or things devoured, </p>
<p class=""line"">and this is all it takes to be beautiful, </p>
<p class=""line"">then God, please, </p>
<p class=""line"">let her </p>
<p class=""line"">eat another apple </p>

<p class=""line"">on the delta of shadows </p>
<p class=""line"">between your shoulder blades— </p>

<p class=""line"">by Lorca’s horn of moonlight, </p>
<p class=""line"">strange unicorn loose along the dim streets </p>
<p class=""line"">separating our skins; </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">to be still again knowing </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">the bow of your spine, the arc of your torso— </p>
<p class=""line"">a widening road to an alabaster mountain, </p>
<p class=""line"">a secret path to a cliff overlooking a sea </p>
<p class=""line"">salt-heavy and laced in foam, a caravel </p>
<p class=""line"">crushing the swells, parting each </p>
<p class=""line"">like blue-skirted thighs—lay before me, </p>
<p class=""line"">another New World shore the gods </p>
<p class=""line"">have chained me to; </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">to have you a last time, at last, a touch away, </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">but then, to not reach out </p>
<p class=""line"">because my hands are dressed in scarves of smoke; </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">to lie silent at your side, </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">an ember more brilliant with each yellow breath, </p>
<p class=""line"">glowing and dying and dying again, </p>
<p class=""line"">dreaming a mesquite forest I once stripped to fire </p>
<p class=""line"">before the sky went ash, undid its dark ribbons, </p>
<p class=""line"">and bent to the ground, grief-ruined, </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">as I watch you from the window— </p>
<p class=""line"">in this city, the city of you, where I am a beggar— </p>

<p class=""line"">Despair has a loose daughter. </p>
<p class=""line"">I lay with her and read the body’s bones </p>
<p class=""line"">like stories. I can tell you the year-long myth </p>

<p class=""line"">The sheets are berserk with wind’s riddling. </p>

<p class=""line"">violet towers. We scour the earth </p>

<p class=""line"">women’s dresses wrinkle </p>

The Beauty of a Busted Fruit,Natalie Diaz,"<p class=""line byline""><em>by <a href=""http://poetry.lib.uidaho.edu/index.php/past-poets/#diaz"">Natalie Diaz</a></em></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">When we were children, we traced our knees, </p>
<p class=""line"">shins, and elbows for the slightest hint of wound, </p>
<p class=""line"">searched them for any sad red-blue scab marking us </p>
<p class=""line"">both victim and survivor. </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">All this before we knew that some wounds can’t heal, </p>
<p class=""line"">before we knew the jagged scars of Great-Grandmother’s </p>
<p class=""line"">amputated legs, the way a rock can split a man’s head </p>
<p class=""line"">open to its red syrup, like a watermelon, the way a brother </p>
<p class=""line"">can pick at his skin for snakes and spiders only he can see. </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Maybe you have grown out of yours— </p>
<p class=""line"">maybe you no longer haul those wounds with you </p>
<p class=""line"">onto every bus, through the side streets of a new town, </p>
<p class=""line"">maybe you have never set them rocking in the lamplight </p>
<p class=""line"">on a nightstand beside a stranger’s bed, carrying your hurts </p>
<p class=""line"">like two cracked pomegranates, because you haven’t learned </p>
<p class=""line"">to see the beauty of a busted fruit, the bright stain it will leave </p>
<p class=""line"">on your lips, the way it will make people want to kiss you. </p>

<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Tonight the city is glimmered. </p>
<p class=""line em3"">What’s left of an August monsoon </p>
<p class=""line"">is heat and wet. Beyond the open window, </p>
<p class=""line em3"">the streetlamp is a honey-skirted hive I could split </p>
<p class=""line"">with my hand, my palm a pool of light. </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line em3"">On the television screen, bombs like silvery bells </p>
<p class=""line"">toll above blurred horizon— </p>
<p class=""line em3"">All I know of war is win. </p>
<p class=""line"">What is a wall if not a thing to be pressed against? </p>
<p class=""line em3"">What is a bedroom if not an epicenter </p>
<p class=""line"">of pillage? And what can I do with a hundred houses </p>
<p class=""line em3"">but abandon them as spent shells of desire? </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">The buzz of blue burning ozone molecules— </p>
<p class=""line em3"">a hypothalamus of cavalry trumpets— </p>
<p class=""line"">call me to something—you, </p>
<p class=""line em3"">so willing to be crushed. I feel like I might die. </p>
<p class=""line"">I lean over, kiss you sitting on the sofa </p>
<p class=""line em3"">and pretend we are lying there </p>
<p class=""line"">stretched across that debris-dazzled desert— </p>
<p class=""line em3"">the only affliction is your mouth, </p>
<p class=""line"">the single ache is that I cannot crawl inside you— </p>
<p class=""line em3"">the explosions are for us. </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">The war is nothing more </p>
<p class=""line em3"">than a reminder to go to Mass. </p>
<p class=""line"">The tolling, your sighing. </p>
<p class=""line em3"">The bombs, a carnival of bodies, touch, </p>
<p class=""line"">all the things we want to taste— </p>
<p class=""line em3"">an apple wedge soaked in vinegar, </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">a blood orange swelling like a breast— </p>
<p class=""line em3"">those beggars of teeth. </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">I want you like that—enough to gnash you </p>
<p class=""line em3"">into a silence made from pieces of silver. </p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Outside, cars rush the slick streets. </p>
<p class=""line em3"">My mouth is on your thigh— </p>
<p class=""line"">I would die to tear just this piece of you away, </p>
<p class=""line em3"">to empty your bright dress onto the floor, </p>
<p class=""line"">as the bombs’ long, shadowy legs, </p>
<p class=""line em3"">march me toward the amaranth gates of the city. </p>

<p></p>
<p class=""line"">There is a dawn between my legs, </p>
<p class=""line"">a rising of mad rouge birds, overflowing </p>
<p class=""line"">and crazy-mean, bronze-tailed hawks, </p>
<p class=""line"">a phoenix preening </p>
<p class=""line"">sharp-hot wings, pretty pecking procession, </p>
<p class=""line"">feathers flashing like flames </p>
<p class=""line"">in a <em>Semana Santa</em> parade. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">There are bulls between my legs, </p>
<p class=""line"">a <em>torera </em></p>
<p class=""line"">stabbing her <em>banderillas</em>, </p>
<p class=""line"">snapping her cape, tippy-toes scraping </p>
<p class=""line"">my mottled thighs, the crowd’s throats open, </p>
<p class=""line"">shining like new scars, <em>cornadas </em>glowing </p>
<p class=""line"">from beneath hands and white handkerchiefs </p>
<p class=""line"">bright as bandages. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">There are car wrecks between my legs, </p>
<p class=""line"">a mess of maroon Volkswagens, </p>
<p class=""line"">a rusted bus abandoned in the Grand Canyon, </p>
<p class=""line"">a gas tanker in flames, </p>
<p class=""line"">an IHS van full of corned beef hash, </p>
<p class=""line"">an open can of commodity beets </p>
<p class=""line"">on this village’s one main road, a stoplight </p>
<p class=""line"">pulsing like a bullet hole, a police car </p>
<p class=""line"">flickering like a new scab, </p>
<p class=""line"">an ambulance driven by Custer, </p>
<p class=""line"">another ambulance </p>
<p class=""line"">for Custer. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">There is a war between my legs, </p>
<p class=""line""><em>’ahway nyavay</em>, a wager, a fight, a losing </p>
<p class=""line"">that cramps my fists, a battle on eroding banks </p>
<p class=""line"">of muddy creeks, the stench of metal, </p>
<p class=""line"">purple-gray clotting the air, </p>
<p class=""line"">in the grass the bodies </p>
<p class=""line"">dim, cracked pomegranates, stone fruit, </p>
<p class=""line"">this orchard stains </p>
<p class=""line"">like a cemetery. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">There is a martyr between my legs, </p>
<p class=""line"">my personal San Sebastián </p>
<p class=""line"">leaking reed arrows and sin, stubbornly sewing </p>
<p class=""line"">a sacred red ribbon dress, <em>ahvay chuchqer</em>, </p>
<p class=""line"">the carmine threads </p>
<p class=""line"">pull the Colorado River, <em>’Aha Haviily</em>, clay, </p>
<p class=""line"">and creosotes from the skirt, </p>
<p class=""line"">each wound a week, </p>
<p class=""line"">a coral moon, a calendar, a begging </p>
<p class=""line"">for a master, or a slave, for a god </p>
<p class=""line"">in magic cochineal pants. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">There are broken baskets between my legs, </p>
<p class=""line"">cracked vases, terra-cotta crumbs, </p>
<p class=""line"">crippled grandmothers with mahogany skins </p>
<p class=""line"">whose ruby shoes throb on shelves in closets, </p>
<p class=""line"">who teach me to vomit </p>
<p class=""line"">this fuchsia madness, </p>
<p class=""line"">this scarlet smallpox blanket, </p>
<p class=""line"">this sugar-riddled amputated robe, </p>
<p class=""line"">these cursive curses scrawling down my calves, </p>
<p class=""line"">this rotting strawberry field, swollen sunset, </p>
<p class=""line"">hemoglobin joke with no punch line, </p>
<p class=""line"">this crimson garbage truck, </p>
<p class=""line"">this bloody nose, splintered cherry tree, <em>manzano</em>, </p>
<p class=""line"">this <em>métis</em> Mary’s heart, </p>
<p class=""line""><em>guitarra acerezada</em>, red race <em>mestiza</em>, this cattle train, </p>
<p class=""line"">this hand-me-down adobe drum, </p>
<p class=""line"">this slug in the mouth, </p>

<p></p>
<p class=""line"">blinking too loudly at parties, shooting</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">at smiling faces with more vengeance</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">than crime or conscience. They capture</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">our gestures, helpless in their sight,</p>

<p class=""line"">just to prove the past or present real.</p>

<p class=""line"">We were children, once; beneath this</p>

Fine,Kim Addonizio,"<p class=""line byline""><em>by <a href=""http://poetry.lib.uidaho.edu/index.php/poets/#addonizio"">Kim Addonizio</a></em></p>
<p>You’re lucky. It’s always them and not you. The family trapped in the fire, the secretary slain in the parking lot holding her coffee and Egg McMuffin, the ones rushed to emergency after the potluck. You’re lucky you didn’t touch the tuna casserole, and went for the baked chicken instead. Your friend with breast cancer that was detected too late—metastasized to the lymph nodes, the lungs, a few months to live—lucky there’s no history in your family. Another friend’s fiancé, heart attack at forty-seven. You lie in bed at night, your head on your lover’s chest, and you’re grateful. Your teenaged daughter, unlike all her friends, hasn’t become sullen or combative, addicted to cigarettes or booze. She’s not in the bathroom with her finger down her throat to throw up dinner. You and your family are fine. You’re happy. It’s like you’re in your own little boat, just you, sailing along, and the wind is up and nothing’s leaking. All around you you can see other boats filling up, flipping over, sliding under. If you look into the water you can watch them for a while, going down slowly, getting smaller and farther away. Soon, if nothing happens to you, if your luck holds, really, holds, you’ll end up completely alone.</p>

<p class=""line"">I want it flimsy and cheap,</p> 
<p class=""line"">I want it too tight, I want to wear it</p> 
<p class=""line"">until someone tears it off me.</p>

<p class=""line"">with all those keys glittering in the window,</p> 
<p class=""line"">past Mr. and Mrs. Wong selling day-old</p>

<p class=""line"">Measure the walls. Count the ribs. Notch the long days.</p> 
<p class=""line"">Look up for blue sky through the spout. Make small fires</p> 
<p class=""line"">with the broken hulls of fishing boats. Practice smoke signals.</p> 
<p class=""line"">Call old friends, and listen for echoes of distant voices.</p> 
<p class=""line"">Organize your calendar. Dream of the beach. Look each way</p> 
<p class=""line"">for the dim glow of light. Work on your reports. Review</p> 
<p class=""line"">each of your life’s ten million choices. Endure moments</p> 
<p class=""line"">of self-loathing. Find the evidence of those before you.</p> 
<p class=""line"">Destroy it. Try to be very quiet, and listen for the sound</p> 
<p class=""line"">of gears and moving water. Listen for the sound of your heart.</p> 
<p class=""line"">Be thankful that you are here, swallowed with all hope,</p> 
<p class=""line"">where you can rest and wait. Be nostalgic. Think of all</p> 
<p class=""line"">the things you did and could have done. Remember</p> 
<p class=""line"">treading water in the center of the still night sea, your toes</p> 
<p class=""line"">pointing again and again down, down to the black depths.</p>

<p class=""line"">I sometimes wish I could find Cindy</p> 
<p class=""line"">to thank her for agreeing with my fine idea</p> 
<p class=""line"">that we sneak into the university chapel</p> 
<p class=""line"">late one night in 1983 to make love.</p> 
<p class=""line"">I don’t just want to thank her for giving me</p> 
<p class=""line"">the trump card—“house of worship”—</p> 
<p class=""line"">I hold in every stupid party game that begins,</p> 
<p class=""line"">“Where’s the strangest place you’ve ever…?”</p> 
<p class=""line"">No, I want to thank her for the truth of it.</p> 
<p class=""line"">For knowing that the heart is holy even when</p> 
<p class=""line"">our own hearts were so frail and callow.</p> 
<p class=""line"">Truth: it was 1983; we were nineteen years old;</p> 
<p class=""line"">we lay below the altar and preached a quiet sermon</p> 
<p class=""line"">not just on the divinity of skin, but on the grace</p> 
<p class=""line"">of the heart beneath. It was the only homily</p> 
<p class=""line"">we knew, and our souls were beatified.</p> 
<p class=""line"">And if you say sentiment and cliché, then that</p> 
<p class=""line"">is what you say. What I know is what is sacred.</p> 
<p class=""line"">Lord of this other world, let me recall that night.</p> 
<p class=""line"">Let me again hear how our whispered exclamations</p> 
<p class=""line"">near the end seemed like rising hymnal rhythm,</p> 
<p class=""line"">and let me feel how those forgotten words came</p> 
<p class=""line"">from somewhere else and meant something.</p> 
<p class=""line"">Something, if only to the single moth</p> 
<p class=""line"">that, in the darkened air of that chapel,</p> 
<p class=""line"">fluttered its dusty wings around our heads.</p>

<p></p>
<p class=""line"">The low tone of heavy December wind</p> 
<p class=""line"">moving through the attic’s slatted vents</p> 
<p class=""line"">awakens the woman lying on her side.</p> 
<p class=""line"">She sees how the muted morning light</p> 
<p class=""line"">drifts through window blinds and how her husband,</p> 
<p class=""line"">who was alive in her dream, is again in the earth.</p> 
<p class=""line"">This is the gray day that the Lord hath made.</p> 
<p class=""line"">She hears the soft, rapid ticking of the clock</p> 
<p class=""line"">beside her bed and how it mingles with</p> 
<p class=""line"">the bells outside. The woman does not know</p> 
<p class=""line"">why the wind chimes sound altogether different</p> 
<p class=""line"">in winter months. She does not know</p> 
<p class=""line"">what puts her in her navy dress and heels,</p> 
<p class=""line"">behind the wheel of her husband’s old sedan,</p> 
<p class=""line"">and into the pew they sat in all those years.</p> 
<p class=""line"">But she stands with the parishioners and mouths</p> 
<p class=""line"">the words of the doxology, her whisper lost</p> 
<p class=""line"">in the throng. She sits back down with them.</p> 
<p class=""line"">Back home, she will read the bulletin</p> 
<p class=""line"">and listen to the cable news anchorman</p> 
<p class=""line"">as if he were a bothersome neighbor child.</p> 
<p class=""line"">She does not know why she will not clean</p> 
<p class=""line"">the tables and mantelpiece of the gathering dust</p> 
<p class=""line"">nor why she has to check each windup clock</p> 
<p class=""line"">before she puts herself back into the dark.</p> 
<p class=""line"">Sometimes she wakes up singing.</p>

<p></p>
<p class=""line"">When they laid you in the crook</p> 
<p class=""line"">of my arms like a bouquet and I looked</p> 
<p class=""line"">into your eyes, dark bits of evening sky,</p> 
<p class=""line"">I thought, <em>of course this is you</em>,</p> 
<p class=""line"">like a person who has never seen the sea</p> 
<p class=""line"">can recognize it instantly.</p> 
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">They pulled you from me like a cork</p> 
<p class=""line"">and all the love flowed out. I adored you</p> 
<p class=""line"">with the squandering passion of spring</p> 
<p class=""line"">that shoots green from every pore.</p> 
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">You dug me out like a well. You lit</p> 
<p class=""line"">the deadwood of my heart. You pinned me</p> 
<p class=""line"">to the earth with the points of stars.</p> 
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">I was sure that kind of love would be</p> 
<p class=""line"">enough. I thought I was your mother.</p> 
<p class=""line"">How could I have known that over and over</p> 
<p class=""line"">you would crack the sky like lightning,</p> 
<p class=""line"">illuminating all my fears, my weaknesses, my sins.</p> 
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Massive the burden this flesh</p> 
<p class=""line"">must learn to bear, like mules of love.</p>

<p></p>
<p class=""line"">I want to know too. Belief and disbelief</p> 
<p class=""line"">are a pair of tourists standing on swollen feet</p> 
<p class=""line"">in the Prado—<em>I don’t like it</em>.</p> 
<p class=""line""><em>I do</em>. —before the Picasso.</p> 
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Or the tattoo artist with a silver stud</p> 
<p class=""line"">in her full red executive lips,</p> 
<p class=""line"">who, as she inked in the indigo blue, said,</p> 
<p class=""line""><em>I think the G-spot’s one of those myths</em></p> 
<p class=""line""><em>men use to make us feel inferior</em>.</p> 
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">God, the G-spot, falling in love. The earth round</p> 
<p class=""line"">and spinning, the galaxies speeding</p> 
<p class=""line"">in the glib flow of the Hubble expansion.</p> 
<p class=""line"">I’m an East Coast Jew. We all have our opinions.</p> 
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">But it was in the cabin at La Selva Beach</p> 
<p class=""line"">where I gave her the thirty tiny red glass hearts</p> 
<p class=""line"">I’d taken back from my husband when I left.</p> 
<p class=""line"">He’d never believed in them. She, though, scooped</p> 
<p class=""line"">them up like water, let them drip through her fingers</p> 
<p class=""line"">like someone who has so much she can afford to waste.</p> 
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">That’s the day she reached inside me</p> 
<p class=""line"">for something I didn’t think I had.</p> 
<p class=""line"">And like pulling a fat shining trout from the river</p> 
<p class=""line"">she pulled the river out of me. That’s</p> 
<p class=""line"">the way I want to know God.</p>

Worry,Ellen Bass,"<p class=""line byline""><em>by <a href=""http://poetry.lib.uidaho.edu/index.php/poets/#bass"">Ellen Bass</a></em></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">“You always think the worst</p> 
<p class=""line"">is going to happen,” Janet says</p> 
<p class=""line"">as we walk with our son along the Amsterdam canals.</p> 
<p class=""line"">“What do you think—he’s going to fall in and drown?”</p> 
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">I have worried</p> 
<p class=""line"">all over the world. It comes to me easily.</p> 
<p class=""line"">Formed slowly through childhood</p> 
<p class=""line"">like stalactites in a cave.</p> 
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">My mother worried to keep going—</p> 
<p class=""line"">a sick husband, the store, children</p> 
<p class=""line"">she wanted everything for. I call her</p> 
<p class=""line"">distraught. Janet’s been dizzy for days.</p> 
<p class=""line"">In the E.R. they inked small x’s</p> 
<p class=""line"">on the parchment map of her skin.</p> 
<p class=""line"">Her doctor’s at a conference in Paris,</p> 
<p class=""line"">and I’m afraid there’s a blood clot near her brain.</p> 
<p class=""line"">“Go buy a plant,” she says. “I’m not going to die.”</p> 
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">My mother tells me I learned it from her—</p> 
<p class=""line"">how to panic. She was thirteen,</p> 
<p class=""line"">oldest of five, when her father left.</p> 
<p class=""line"">My grandmother worried to keep food</p> 
<p class=""line"">on the table. Every week</p> 
<p class=""line"">she’d board the bus to buy</p> 
<p class=""line"">dry goods, children’s clothes, socks</p> 
<p class=""line"">to sell in her corner store.</p> 
<p class=""line"">When she didn’t climb down</p> 
<p class=""line"">from the six o’clock—winter,</p> 
<p class=""line"">it was already dark—my mother sat</p> 
<p class=""line"">in the window, tears rumpling her face,</p> 
<p class=""line"">praying, <em>Let her come home</em>.</p> 
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">And in Russia—my father was a baby</p> 
<p class=""line"">when his mother carried him and two brothers</p> 
<p class=""line"">to the border. Hiding</p> 
<p class=""line"">in the forest undergrowth, my father</p> 
<p class=""line"">crying, she heard boots</p> 
<p class=""line"">bite through the crusted snow. Some women</p> 
<p class=""line"">smothered infants. What must have gone</p> 
<p class=""line"">through her mind when the steps hesitated,</p> 
<p class=""line"">before turning away?</p> 
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Janet doesn’t think about what</p> 
<p class=""line"">might happen. She thinks about what is.</p> 
<p class=""line"">But I carry dread on my shoulders</p> 
<p class=""line"">like a knapsack, like the extra pounds</p> 
<p class=""line"">my grandmother wanted me to gain.</p> 
<p class=""line"">She’d read about a girl in a plane crash.</p> 
<p class=""line"">All she had to eat was snow.</p>

<p></p>
<p class=""line"">The key</p>

Data,Devin Becker,"<p class=""line byline""><em>by <a href=""http://poetry.lib.uidaho.edu/index.php/poets/#becker"">Devin Becker</a></em></p>
<p></p>
<p>If you believe everything is data, a pulsing sphere of inputs and outputs feeding off each other&mdash;circumstance being both the mold and what is molded&mdash;an act of Terrorism (that constant), however gratuitous, must be considered a kind of natural disaster, as it is, at base, a release, from the system, of a tension built by the rubbing together of opposite and incongruous desires.<br />
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;One birthday, ever the Protestant, I decided I should remind myself the world suffered while I celebrated, so I downloaded the lead <em>New York Times</em> photo&mdash;an Iraqi woman crying over the charred spot where her boy had perished&mdash;and let it devastate me for a while.<br />
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Now it’s stored with my other image files&mdash;paintings I like, photos from bars, etc.&mdash;and like them, it comes up sometimes on my screensaver.<br />
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I’m so used to it now, I barely see it anymore&mdash;the charred spot like a brushstroke, her white teeth above the black O of her open mouth. The scene floats by without charge; the shock of it used up when? That first day?<br />
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;(My life consumed by itself, myself, my data. My dataset, my healthy dataset&mdash;)<br />
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;When the photo comes up with guests over and someone notices, I use the occasion to anecdote about my Midwestern/Protestant guilt-ethic.<br />
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Oh and we laugh. We laugh for what seems ages.</p>

Parking Lot,Devin Becker,"<p class=""line byline""><em>by <a href=""http://poetry.lib.uidaho.edu/index.php/poets/#becker"">Devin Becker</a></em></p>
<p></p>
<p>I am looking for a spot that will retain no meaning, no charge. So I drive her to a dentist’s office—not my dentist, not hers—and in the parking lot I tell her it’s over, the whole thing. I tell her our relationship “is untenable.” 
&emsp;&emsp;We look out the windshield into the office, the rooms all fluorescent, those horrible, reclined chairs, and white, white everywhere. 
&emsp;&emsp;She tells me this just proves what she’s always thought, what she believes on “a very personal level,” that she’s “a character actor in her own life.” 
&emsp;&emsp;It’s a phrase she’s been savoring, I realize, and so accurate a description I’m surprised she hasn’t told me sooner, during a lull in one of our many restaurant dinners. 
&emsp;&emsp;But I would have lied and told her it wasn’t true, and she didn’t want to be unconvinced of it, her revelation.</p> 
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;(And what, asks the protagonist, is so</p> 
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;bad about being a character actor?</p> 
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<em>Everyone steals from you.)</em></p> 
<p>&emsp;&emsp;Some security guy drives past us so I start the car up, relieved to have a reason. 
&emsp;&emsp;He’s got these scraggly whiskers that hang inches off his cheeks, and as he passes, he gives me a look. 
&emsp;&emsp;This is his spot, I think. We’re in his spot.</p>

<p class=""line"">round licorice sticks the Belgian nuns gave me for six</p>
<p class=""line"">good conduct points on Sundays after mass.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;Love it when ‘plethora’, ‘indolence’, ‘damask’,</p>

<p class=""line"">thicken my saliva, sweet as those sticks—black</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;and slick with every lick it took to make daggers</p>
<p class=""line"">out of them: sticky spikes I brandished straight up</p>
<p class=""line"">to the ebony crucifix in the dorm, with the pride</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;of a child more often punished than praised.</p>
<p class=""line"">‘Amuck,’ ‘awkward,’ or ‘knuckles,’ have jaw-</p>
<p class=""line"">breaker flavors; there’s honey in ‘hunter’s moon,’</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;hot pepper in ‘hunk,’ and ‘mellifluous’ has aromas</p>
<p class=""line"">of almonds and milk. Those tastes of recompense</p>

<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;English in my mouth, repeating its syllables</p>

<p></p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;A friend had a Minnesota catalogue company</p>
<p class=""line"">send me plant-them-yourself dahlias by mail.</p>
<p class=""line"">The tubers nested in a rumpled mess of shredded paper.</p>
<p class=""line"">One strip, caught deep in a root’s cleavage</p>
<p class=""line"">resisted, wouldn’t come out. I pulled carefully</p>
<p class=""line"">at the white paper, reading its truncated sentence:</p>
<p class=""line"">. . . <em>enclosed manuscript for your Poetry Prize. I hope</em> . . .</p> 
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;I remembered those publishers’ guidelines:</p>
<p class=""line""><em>we will recycle those manuscripts not selected,</em></p>
<p class=""line""><em>in a manner that will maintain the writers’ privacy</em>.</p>
<p class=""line"">Shredded, they sent the mess to nurseries, to protect</p>
<p class=""line"">other bundles from being mishandled, torn. It took me</p>
<p class=""line"">three hours to separate the fragments of that specific</p>
<p class=""line"">font and paper from the other strips. I saved seven lines.</p> 
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;So this poem is for you—the one who wrote:</p>
<p class=""line""><em>blossom twigs in a glass jar by the bed and God of the hinge,</em></p>
<p class=""line""><em>potential or fallen: it’s that time of doubt again</em>.</p>
<p class=""line"">I want you to know I love that line, its surrendering tone,</p>
<p class=""line"">its rhythm—and pinned it to my wall. In Autumn,</p>
<p class=""line"">when my first red dahlia blooms, I’ll put it</p>
<p class=""line"">in a glass jar, and place it under the word <em>fallen</em>.</p>

<p></p>
<p>If angry, simple—say, <em>That really pisses me off</em>. But just frustrated? <em>That burns me up</em>. Or if that lawyer is after you and he’s <em>all bent out of shape</em>, you might decide not to pick up the phone, <em>cause the more you stir shit, the more it stinks</em>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If your daughter finally did something right, like fix the cable box, say, <em>Shoot fire, bout time</em>, or you may want to give encouragement (you want her to hook up your VCR too) so snap your fingers, exclaim, <em>Handle it, Roy! Handle it!</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>If someone tries to deceive you—a car dealer, rolling the Caddy’s odometer back, or your granddaughter, blaming a dent in that new car on a mango that fell green from your tree—say, <em>Don’t you piss on my head and tell me it’s raining</em>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If winter, leave one window open, because you can’t stand being closed in, but make sure to fuss—<em>It’s cold as a witch’s tiddy</em>, and if below zero, the witch should be <em>in a metal bra</em>. If hot, you’re flashing, which happens most year-round, it will likely be <em>hot as a dick, hot as piss, somebody get me a fresh Pepsi, crank up the air, quick</em>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If hungry, this one’s easy—<em>I’m bout to starve</em>—but if really hungry, add <em>to death</em> or <em>my ass off</em>. After two bowls of pinto beans and cornbread with green onion and sliced tomato and Frank’s Red Hot, you’re full, ask for your Tums, make a metaphor of your bloat to <em>a tick, high up on a hog, about to pop</em>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If a lamp’s expensive, say, <em>Shew, that’s high</em>, and use the card, but if you could never afford it, not in a million years, that lamp’s <em>as high as a cat’s back</em>. Say, <em>You can keep your money, I won’t let the back of your door hit me in the ass</em>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If a girl’s got pocked skin, buck teeth, and stringy hair, say <em>God bless her</em>, but if she’s gone off and given head to every boy in the eleventh grade, the whore’s heart might be <em>peapicking</em>, <em>little</em>, or worse—both—as in, <em>God bless her little, pea-pickin heart</em>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now, if something real sad happens to the lady next door—the cancer took over, there’s nothing left the doctor can cut away—say, <em>Ain’t that a cotton-pickin shame</em>, but if her husband’s running around while she’s pumped with chemo, close the door, talk only in a whisper, even if no one else is in the whole house. Start the conversation with <em>I ain’t one to say nothing, but you wouldn’t believe</em>; end with <em>We better not say nothing, no, not a word</em>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you’re the one brought low because that neighbor is your sister and you heard what’s in her tumor-blocked bowels has started to come out of her mouth, <em>It ain’t worth going into</em>, there’s nothing to say. Best to make the girls ammonia the chandelier and fluff the couch pillows and brush the shag rugs and windex the mirrored backsplash and take all the just-cleaned crystal down to clean again—<em>This house is filthy. We ain’t discussing it. Now, leave me be. Hey, I bet there’s something good on the tee-vee. Don’t give me no shit now, really. Don’t you know Grandma’s had enough—enough of tears?</em></p>

Fanny Linguistics: Superstition,Nickole Brown,"<p class=""line byline""><em>by <a href=""http://poetry.lib.uidaho.edu/index.php/poets/#brown"">Nickole Brown</a></em></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">In Fanny’s house, there were ways of killing</p>
<p class=""line"">someone by walking alone: I could step over</p>
<p class=""line"">my youngest uncle sprawled watching TV,</p>
<p class=""line"">could step over his boy heart or leg or arm—</p>
<p class=""line"">it wouldn’t matter which—because <em>unless you step back</em></p>
<p class=""line""><em>over him, right quick, by morning he’ll be</em></p>
<p class=""line""><em>gone</em>.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Same goes for a bird let in the house—a sparrow</p>
<p class=""line"">in the laundry room had wings</p>
<p class=""line"">of the Great Scythe, and a black crow</p>
<p class=""line"">tangled in the living room curtains could well wipe</p>
<p class=""line"">the whole family out. And should you dream</p>
<p class=""line"">of losing your teeth—that meant death</p>
<p class=""line"">coming sure as an owl shits</p>
<p class=""line"">tiny bones of mice in the middle of the night;</p>
<p class=""line"">it was a full-on omen, start baking</p>
<p class=""line"">the funeral casseroles now.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Funny, all that hoo-doo about dying with no intent</p>
<p class=""line"">to remember the dead—how Fanny hated photographs:</p>
<p class=""line""><em>I don’t take pictures</em>, she said. <em>It just makes me sad</em>,</p>
<p class=""line""><em>and if anything ever did happen</em></p>
<p class=""line""><em>to one of the kids, I don’t want to be left</em></p>
<p class=""line""><em>staring at their face</em>.</p>

"For My Grandmother's Feet, Swollen Again",Nickole Brown,"<p class=""line byline""><em>by <a href=""http://poetry.lib.uidaho.edu/index.php/poets/#brown"">Nickole Brown</a></em></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">But for one pair of storebought boots,</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;your two feet grew up barefoot</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;with no idea you’d be bedridden,</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;expecting for the last time at forty</p>
<p class=""line"">your seventh child. And your sixth—</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;your youngest daughter—my mother,</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;would play shoe shop with a string.</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It’s her favorite story: how she laced</p>
<p class=""line"">your feet with pretend ribbon,</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;pretend satin, pretend lace,</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;how she tied a bow and said,</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<em>How about this pair, Mama</em>,</p> 
<p></p>
<p class=""line""><em>would these do?</em> I can’t say</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I was there, but the half of me</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;that was round and fully formed</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;nested in the mouth of her ovary,</p>
<p class=""line"">waiting to be allowed down</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;its long swan throat, and at times</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;when I’m too sick to get out of bed,</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I curl the edge of a haunted sheet</p>
<p class=""line"">between my toes to feel</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;a pair of imaginary slippers</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;made by a little girl who waits</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;for me at the edge of my bed. This memory—</p> 
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">is it mine to have? My feet</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;are three sizes too big, paddle feet,</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;unpolished, feet that never bore</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;the weight of child and might never</p>
<p class=""line"">will. But still, when my body fevers,</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;when I am weak, there is something</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;bittersweet threading the loneliest part</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;of me, something that says, <em>Now</em>,</p> 
<p></p>
<p class=""line""><em>it’s time. I’ve made you new shoes</em>.</p>

Dancing at Your Wedding,Fleda Brown,"<p class=""line byline""><em>by <a href=""http://poetry.lib.uidaho.edu/index.php/poets/#brown"">Fleda Brown</a></em></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">I wish I hadn’t danced like that, un-</p>
<p class=""line"">dignified, wild, but consider your groom’s</p>
<p class=""line"">family, full press of uncles, aunts, parents,</p>
<p class=""line"">generations of sticking together, then your own</p>
<p class=""line"">scattered mess of faithlessness, and there</p>
<p class=""line"">you are, father on one arm, me on your other,</p>
<p class=""line"">two captive animals lured to the same pen.</p>
<p class=""line"">There I am on the old VCR tape,</p>
<p class=""line"">flouncing, you could say that,</p>
<p class=""line"">into the reception with my new man,</p>
<p class=""line"">your ex-stepfather crazily lurking</p>
<p class=""line"">in the background. I’m wearing the filmy,</p>
<p class=""line"">matronly mother-of-the bride-thing, grief</p>
<p class=""line"">and joy thrashing in me like sumo wrestlers.</p>
<p class=""line"">There we are, all layers of time</p>
<p class=""line"">licensed to be here, and I am the smoke</p>
<p class=""line"">of the speed of the rewind, in my smoky</p>
<p class=""line"">blue dress among the calla lilies</p>
<p class=""line"">and candles, and you a grand beaded</p>
<p class=""line"">snowy island, a bell-voice at the microphone,</p>
<p class=""line"">thanking us all, in general, and then I’m dancing</p>
<p class=""line"">and dancing, stricken and turning, turning</p>
<p class=""line"">my eyes. Imagine if Hades followed Persephone</p>
<p class=""line"">back into spring and summer, not speaking,</p>
<p class=""line"">sitting at a side table fingering the stem</p>
<p class=""line"">of his glass, cupping its bowl, smiling</p>
<p class=""line"">with his white teeth! Imagine if Rousseau</p>
<p class=""line"">got up to speak of the goodness of the human heart,</p>
<p class=""line"">and yours still bloody, the sweet smell</p>
<p class=""line"">of a gardenia loud as a band</p>
<p class=""line"">playing just under your chin.</p>

<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Was beauteously, bulbously huge—redundant</p>
<p class=""line"">as a luminous moon—puffed and balled,</p>
<p class=""line"">seized by Uncle Richmond from the deep woods,</p>
<p class=""line"">plucked with both hands and brought</p>
<p class=""line"">to the doorstep for our amazement</p>
<p class=""line"">and accolades, and to be sliced and fried,</p>
<p class=""line"">tasting like nothing but slightly singed butter,</p>
<p class=""line"">which we happily shared back then, several years</p>
<p class=""line"">before he collapsed on the porch at 85</p>
<p class=""line"">with a heart attack, having driven forty miles</p>
<p class=""line"">from Petoskey home clutching his chest,</p>
<p class=""line"">sweat streaming after the meeting</p>
<p class=""line"">where the argument was made to inject</p>
<p class=""line"">toxic wastes under the “perfectly safe” shelf</p>
<p class=""line"">of rock to mingle in the underground seas and sift</p>
<p class=""line"">slowly out to the Great Lakes as has happened</p>
<p class=""line"">before. He stood and said so, hands shaking</p>
<p class=""line"">more than usual, so that on the dark road home</p>
<p class=""line"">he had to stop for a minute near King’s Orchard</p>
<p class=""line"">then drive on, legs finally giving way</p>
<p class=""line"">on his own front porch, Lee luckily hearing</p>
<p class=""line"">something like a branch falling, so he survived,</p>
<p class=""line"">lean and leaving to range through the forests</p>
<p class=""line"">after the fantastical and favor us with the tale</p>
<p class=""line"">of it, again, or occasionally with the whole thing,</p>
<p class=""line"">harbored and carried into our presence,</p>
<p class=""line"">a careful joy, mysteriously magnified, come</p>
<p class=""line"">upon as if the earth had started suddenly over.</p>

Venus de Milo,Fleda Brown,"<p class=""line byline""><em>by <a href=""http://poetry.lib.uidaho.edu/index.php/poets/#brown"">Fleda Brown</a></em></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">The moon is a bleached marble the color of the Venus de Milo.</p>
<p class=""line"">It gets so full of itself it breaks through whole centuries.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">In this twenty-first one, I am called upstairs by my grandson Noah</p>
<p class=""line"">to see the full moon over Paris. I tell him about the centuries</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">inside the marble, layers and streaks. How the sculptor studies</p>
<p class=""line"">the grain. How even then it can break out of control. Jab the chisel</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">too far, it leaves a white bruise. Mystery is both cool and cruel,</p>
<p class=""line"">I’m thinking, if you stay with it, as Noah and I do on the balcony</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">trying to take a picture that didn’t come out, that resisted us,</p>
<p class=""line"">the way the Venus de Milo did in the afternoon, with her missing</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">arms, holding herself in, turning us back toward details. I explain</p>
<p class=""line"">to Noah how rasps and rifflers are used for the final shaping. I explain</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">love and beauty in the language of work, what else is there to say?</p>
<p class=""line"">why mention how much is free-fall—accident—the combination</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">of genes and skill that turn them to face each other like two mirrors</p>
<p class=""line"">making their long corridor of escape? I just climb the 64 stairs</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">to the balcony, panting. I say it’s nothing. But then we step</p>
<p class=""line"">into the dark and enter beauty, where there never was a foothold.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">I might have told him that, but just then we were looking at the moon.</p>

String Theories,Deborah Brown,"<p class=""line byline""><em>by <a href=""http://poetry.lib.uidaho.edu/index.php/poets/#brown"">Deborah Brown</a></em></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I say nothing</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">about how fast the light travels</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;or of Einstein’s problem catching up with it,</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;or of Ludwig Boltzmann, who killed himself</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">when scientists mocked his belief</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;in other dimensions. Today</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;the strings of Boltzmann’s theory</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">have stories to tell, they</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;pulsate to anyone’s rhythm.</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I hold you in ten dimensions,</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">wish you safe in all of them.</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I know space and time curl around strings</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;that give rise to the gravity</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">which holds us here, the way the notes</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;of Mozart’s Requiem scrolled</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;on his last staves. The invisible strings</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">in us spin themselves into specks of light,</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;and two new forces one strong and one weak,</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;draw us together. This is the complicated</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">shape of our time together, our past and present</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;woven into a fragment of the sky.</p>

Small Sorrows,Deborah Brown,"<p class=""line byline""><em>by <a href=""http://poetry.lib.uidaho.edu/index.php/poets/#brown"">Deborah Brown</a></em></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">You can start anywhere,</p>
<p class=""line"">you can start with the hummingbird</p>
<p class=""line"">that quivers at the feeder, or with a moon</p>
<p class=""line"">lost in the corner, or the stray dog who creeps</p>
<p class=""line"">to my window and breathes. But not with</p>
<p class=""line"">the Lebanese woman on TV who sobs as she</p>
<p class=""line"">trudges back to her house of rubble.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">How can I tell you my small sorrows?</p>
<p class=""line"">In Slovenia, at the Nazi prison in Begunje,</p>
<p class=""line"">you can see the last writing of two British</p>
<p class=""line"">soldiers. On the stone of a shared cell, each</p>
<p class=""line"">scraped the facts he pared himself down to:</p>
<p class=""line"">name, address, parents, schools, date of enlistment,</p>
<p class=""line"">rank, battalion, date and place taken prisoner, and</p>
<p class=""line"">the date which became the year of death.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">I didn’t want to start there.</p>
<p class=""line"">I don’t want to end there. But no matter where I start,</p>
<p class=""line"">or end, I will tell you—that if I could</p>
<p class=""line"">touch you, I would become a hummingbird, a hidden,</p>

<p class=""line"">I forget if young girls still sleep</p>
<p class=""line"">with their boredom beneath their pillows</p>
<p class=""line"">until a boy says, I love you.</p>
<p class=""line"">My mother planted her boredom</p>

<p class=""line"">There’s a pattern developing here.</p>
<p class=""line"">No one is allowed</p>
<p class=""line"">in the basement of sleep</p>
<p class=""line"">but an old nun sits at the door</p>
<p class=""line"">and sells postcards with a colorful,</p>
<p class=""line"">but badly lit, photograph of it.</p>
<p class=""line"">There are times when boredom is a hand</p>
<p class=""line"">over a flame until the smell of burning flesh.</p>
<p class=""line"">For miles that night, silverfish, dead, floating</p>
<p class=""line"">at the surface, a piece of the moon on each.</p>
<p class=""line"">I drove past people looking up at the roof of a bank,</p>
<p class=""line"">arms motionless at their sides,</p>
<p class=""line"">a staggering scene of languor.</p>
<p class=""line"">It’s always a warm afternoon</p>

My Uncanny Resemblance to a Young Sean Connery,Rick Bursky,"<p class=""line byline""><em>by <a href=""http://poetry.lib.uidaho.edu/index.php/poets/#bursky"">Rick Bursky</a></em></p>
<p></p>
<p align=justify>Walking out of a Thai restaurant on Wilshire Boulevard in Santa Monica I was hit on the head with a wine bottle. It was night. At the instant of impact, a Santa Monica policewoman was leaving the See’s Candies across the street. I didn’t see the man who attacked me. The policewoman did. I didn’t feel the bottle against my skull, opened my eyes an hour later in the emergency room. In the parking lot behind the restaurant my attacker put his hands behind his head and allowed himself to be handcuffed rather than test the discipline of the policewoman’s finger on the trigger of her black Beretta. Doctors shined small beams of light into my eyes. Bursts of color. I slipped back to sleep. This was fourteen years after the collapse of the Soviet Union. My attacker, an unemployed Russian immigrant, claimed to be a one-time KGB agent, who believed early James Bond movies were documentaries. He decided on the attack when he saw me eating shrimp Pad Thai and talking with Alexis about the <em>New York Review of Books</em>. She was in the restroom when I was struck, held my hand in the ambulance as it carried me through the night. After killing an infamous enemy agent my attacker would return to Russia and find work with one of the many ex-KGB officers running a security company. This was real life, not a movie. The bottle didn’t break. I spent three days in the hospital. After thirteen months in the Los Angeles County Jail my attacker was deported to Russia. I was upset to learn that the crime he was deported for was stealing the wine bottle and not what he did with it.</p>

<p></p>
<p class=""line"">The girl was crossing the street, birthday cake in hand.</p>
<p class=""line"">The bus against the curb blocked traffic.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;My daughter dances three nights a week</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;with graceful insects—level three, purple leotards.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Last night playing softball in the park, I leaned</p>
<p class=""line"">against the fence where the girl’s friends left flowers.</p>
<p class=""line""><em>You will never be forgotten</em>, the scrawled sign read.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I was dropping my daughter off at dance that night</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;right after the accident. Body parts strewn across the road</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;in front of the studio. Even the police looked stricken.</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I swerved around them, kept going. My daughter</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;claims she closed her eyes and saw nothing.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">At softball, I eyed the frayed flowers, the plaintive sign</p>
<p class=""line"">streaked by rain. Liquid life goes on, and everyone</p>
<p class=""line"">is forgotten. I was 2 for 3 and made a nice play</p>
<p class=""line"">at second. I cannot tell you the final score.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I cannot tell you who that birthday cake was for,</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;splattered amid the gore. The ritual singing of sirens.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">The other team had some asshole pitching,</p>
<p class=""line"">whining about every call. Old guy my age</p>
<p class=""line"">who should’ve known better than to care: Ball. Strike.</p>
<p class=""line"">Safe. Out. Who cares? Nobody got hurt—</p>
<p class=""line"">at our age, isn’t that enough, oh worthy opponent?</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;A severed leg in the road. You can still see</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;the imperfect yellow circles drawn by police, fading.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Oh, dancing daughter. Watch me make a catch. Watch me</p>
<p class=""line"">run the bases. Open your eyes, girl.</p>

<p></p>
<p class=""line"">During the last 50 miles back from haul & some</p>
<p class=""line"">months past my 15th birthday, my father fishes</p>
<p class=""line"">a stuffed polar bear from a Salvation Army</p>
<p class=""line"">gift-bin, labeled <em>Boys: 6-10</em>. I can almost see him</p>
<p class=""line"">approach the decision: cold, a little hungry, not enough</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">money in his pocket for coffee. He worries</p>
<p class=""line"">he might fall asleep behind the wheel as his giant,</p>
<p class=""line"">clumsy love for that small word—<em>son</em>—guides</p>
<p class=""line"">his gaze to the crudely-sewn fabric of the miniature bear</p>
<p class=""line"">down at the bottom of the barrel. Seasons have flared</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">& gone out with little change in his fear of stopping</p>
<p class=""line"">for too long in any city, where he knows the addict</p>
<p class=""line"">in him waits, patient as a desert bloom. Meanwhile, me:</p>
<p class=""line"">his eldest child, the uneasy guardian of the house.</p>
<p class=""line"">In his absence, I’ve not yet lost my virginity,</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">but I’ve had fist-fights with grown men & seen</p>
<p class=""line"">my mother dragging her religious beliefs to the bitter</p>
<p class=""line"">border of divorce. For years my father’s had trouble</p>
<p class=""line"">saying <em>no</em> to crack-cocaine & women flowered in cheap</p>
<p class=""line"">summer dresses. Watch his face as he arrives at last</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">& stretches the toy out, my mother fixed</p>
<p class=""line"">on the porch behind me, the word <em>son</em> suddenly heavy</p>
<p class=""line"">in my father’s mouth, his gray coat gathered</p>
<p class=""line"">around his shoulders: he’s never looked so small.</p>
<p class=""line"">We could crush him—we hug him instead.</p>

<p class=""line"">we knew already what we wanted</p>
<p class=""line"">long before we noticed the slow gesture</p>
<p class=""line"">of her fingers: flower to scissors, to vase,</p>
<p class=""line"">to flower again. Her painful carefulness—:</p>
<p class=""line"">that anonymous labor for more</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">beauty <em>qua</em> beauty. She almost convinces us</p>
<p class=""line"">to forget the fruit and choose the flower</p>

<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<em>—for R</em></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">When you’re in love with someone</p>
<p class=""line"">whose father has committed suicide, you demand</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">that the world be gentle with her now.</p>
<p class=""line"">The world, of course, will not listen.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Still you go through the motions—smile to her</p>
<p class=""line"">assure her of the small, human ways the world</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">will bend softly, now that you have set it straight.</p>
<p class=""line"">And suddenly, to spite you, suicide shows up</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">everywhere. No story is safe, and people</p>
<p class=""line"">these days will kill themselves over anything:</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">the home-team loss, stalled traffic, sappy love songs</p>
<p class=""line"">overplayed on the radio. You find yourself turning</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">the conversations, the channels, storming out together</p>
<p class=""line"">midway through movies. At the rental store, hand in hand,</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">you learn to predict nooses and medicine cabinets,</p>
<p class=""line"">suicidal tendencies coded in DVD descriptions.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">And you lie: <em>The reviews got this one all wrong—or</em></p>
<p class=""line""><em>—I’ve seen this one, darling. It would put us both to sleep.</em></p>

<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Not rain, but fine mist</p>
<p class=""line"">falls from my lemon tree,</p>
<p class=""line"">a balm of droplets in green shadow.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Six years now my mother gone to earth.</p>
<p class=""line"">This dew, light as footsteps of the dead.</p>
<p class=""line"">She often walked out here, craned her neck,</p>
<p class=""line"">considered the fruit, hundreds of globes</p>
<p class=""line"">in their leathery hides, figuring on</p>
<p class=""line"">custard and pudding, meringue and</p>
<p class=""line"">hollandaise.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">But her plans didn’t work out.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">The tree goes on unceasingly—lemons fall</p>
<p class=""line"">and fold into earth and begin again—</p>
<p class=""line"">me, I come here as a salve against heat,</p>
<p class=""line"">come to languish, to let the soft bursts—</p>
<p class=""line"">essence of citrus, summer’s distillate—</p>
<p class=""line"">drift into my face and settle. Water and gold</p>
<p class=""line"">brew in the quiet deeps at the far end</p>
<p class=""line"">of the season. Leaves swallow the body</p>
<p class=""line"">of light and the breath of water brims over.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">My hands cup each other the way hers did.</p>

<p></p>
<p class=""line"">And if I made a bad meal, if leftovers,</p>
<p class=""line"">my husband bent to scrape them into the bowl,</p>
<p class=""line"">summoning our hound for the favor</p>
<p class=""line"">of her indiscriminate desire,</p>
<p class=""line"">his brows scowling together, yes, I’d open the back door</p>
<p class=""line"">into the garage just to let the rancor out, the dog</p>
<p class=""line"">stood in for me, her mad panicked barking.</p>
<p class=""line"">I was pregnant, thick with it, thought to</p>
<p class=""line"">become a woman finally, not that stick,</p>
<p class=""line"">that boy I’d always been—instead,</p>
<p class=""line"">a heavy figure forever wrong at dinner.</p>
<p class=""line"">He didn’t want to be a father.</p>
<p class=""line"">And yes, I witnessed the improbable nest</p>
<p class=""line"">a stranger’s long labor, boogie board gnawed</p>
<p class=""line"">to snowdrops lining the far corner.</p>
<p class=""line"">We came face to face—rich silver of her ruff,</p>
<p class=""line"">long pink tail sprouting wiry hairs like a woman’s bristled chin,</p>
<p class=""line"">a quick palsy ran through her shoulders—<em>discovered</em>—</p>
<p class=""line"">the possum must have known it then—her ruin.</p>
<p class=""line"">She met my gaze, lifting her plush and fragile nose.</p>
<p class=""line"">Against my belly wall three rivers fed the blue placenta,</p>
<p class=""line"">little matter moored by cable coiled in that water.</p>
<p class=""line"">She stood her ground, lips drawn back,</p>
<p class=""line"">teeth bared. Don’t tell me what love endures</p>
<p class=""line"">or need requires, don’t tell me animals can’t make</p>
<p class=""line"">mortal calculation. I knew she was carrying too,</p>
<p class=""line"">building bits of flesh that fall into the world,</p>
<p class=""line"">thirteen teats for a litter of two dozen</p>
<p class=""line"">infants the size of honey bees scrabbling for the pouch,</p>
<p class=""line"">and if half of what we sow is strewn on barren ground—</p>
<p class=""line"">scorched, choked, devoured by birds—still,</p>
<p class=""line"">all must be borne.</p>

<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Fifteen miles west of Boston</p>
<p class=""line"">and mostly the news is of small creatures</p>
<p class=""line"">and snow. A self-appointed snow inspector,</p>
<p class=""line"">I tune in to the weather: snow and sun,</p>
<p class=""line"">sometimes clouds or showers or wind</p>
<p class=""line"">or chattering letters that spell <em>chilly</em>.</p>
<p class=""line"">As with everywhere I’ve lived</p>
<p class=""line"">the forecasters look like</p>
<p class=""line"">Vanna White surrogates or</p>
<p class=""line"">used-car salesmen. Still,</p>
<p class=""line"">they grow on you</p>
<p class=""line"">like poker pals upping the ante—</p>
<p class=""line"">with shifts of pressure.</p>
<p class=""line"">Sometimes the weather calls their bluff.</p>
<p class=""line"">Still, they, at least, seem to know</p>
<p class=""line"">where they are. Right now</p>
<p class=""line"">a light snow is falling,</p>
<p class=""line"">a steady downpour</p>
<p class=""line"">of flakes fine as gnats.</p>
<p class=""line"">To her usual, “What’s up?”</p>
<p class=""line"">I give my old friend the usual answer:</p>
<p class=""line"">“Same old shit shoveled a different way.”</p>
<p class=""line"">I bundle up. Before I thread my fingers</p>
<p class=""line"">through the shovel’s handle,</p>
<p class=""line"">it flashes a conspiratorial grin.</p>

<p class=""line"">I was eleven the first time I saw it,</p>
<p class=""line"">the November afternoon gone</p>
<p class=""line"">heavy and gray. I’d begun</p>
<p class=""line"">to doze when something—</p>
<p class=""line"">not palm fronds rustling</p>
<p class=""line"">nor monkey pods rattling,</p>
<p class=""line"">but more like spoons against glass</p>
<p class=""line"">or small bells—something began</p>
<p class=""line"">clinking against the second story’s</p>
<p class=""line"">blue palings and rails, lightly at first,</p>
<p class=""line"">bringing all of us, even the teacher,</p>
<p class=""line"">to our feet and out the door.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Not since,</p>
<p class=""line"">three years before, when the staticky</p>
<p class=""line"">Standard Oil broadcast had been</p>
<p class=""line"">interrupted by news that brought to tears</p>
<p class=""line"">even Miss Engard (who didn’t tax</p>
<p class=""line"">our imaginations too hard playing</p>
<p class=""line"">the part of witch at Halloween)</p>
<p class=""line"">had there been so much commotion.</p>
<p class=""line"">Seeing our teachers openly weeping</p>
<p class=""line"">had frightened us even more than a word</p>
<p class=""line"">like <em>assassination</em>.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Above us,</p>
<p class=""line"">concrete. Under our feet, concrete.</p>
<p class=""line"">And all of us stretching our hands</p>
<p class=""line"">beyond the blue rails to catch,</p>
<p class=""line"">as they fell, clear pieces of sky</p>
<p class=""line"">that burned a second,</p>
<p class=""line"">melting in our hands.</p>

<p class=""line"">Another word for <em>father</em> is <em>worry</em>.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Worry boils the water</p>
<p class=""line"">for tea in the middle of the night.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Worry trimmed the child’s nails before</p>
<p class=""line"">singing him to sleep.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Another word for <em>son</em> is <em>delight</em>,</p>
<p class=""line"">another word, <em>hidden</em>.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">And another is <em>One-Who-Goes-Away</em>.</p>
<p class=""line"">Yet another, <em>One-Who-Returns</em>.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">So many words for son:</p>
<p class=""line""><em>He-Dreams-for-All-Our-Sakes</em>.</p>
<p class=""line""><em>His-Play-Vouchsafes-Our-Winter-Share</em>.</p>
<p class=""line""><em>His-Dispersal-Wins-the-Birds</em>.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">But only one word for <em>father</em>.</p>
<p class=""line"">And sometimes a man is both.</p>
<p class=""line"">Which is to say sometimes a man</p>
<p class=""line"">manifests mysteries beyond</p>
<p class=""line"">his own understanding.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">For instance, being the one and the many,</p>
<p class=""line"">and the loneliness of either. Or</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">the living light we see by, we never see. Or</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">the sole word weighs</p>
<p class=""line"">heavy as a various name.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">And sleepless worry folds the laundry for tomorrow.</p>
<p class=""line"">Tired worry wakes the child for school.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Orphan worry writes the note he hides</p>

Persimmons,Li-Young Lee,"<p class=""line byline""><em>by <a href=""http://poetry.lib.uidaho.edu/index.php/poets/#lee"">Li-Young Lee</a></em></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">In sixth grade Mrs. Walker</p>
<p class=""line"">slapped the back of my head</p>
<p class=""line"">and made me stand in the corner</p>
<p class=""line"">for not knowing the difference</p>
<p class=""line"">between <em>persimmon</em> and <em>precision</em>.</p>
<p class=""line"">How to choose</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">persimmons. This is precision.</p>
<p class=""line"">Ripe ones are soft and brown-spotted.</p>
<p class=""line"">Sniff the bottoms. The sweet one</p>
<p class=""line"">will be fragrant. How to eat:</p>
<p class=""line"">put the knife away, lay down newspaper.</p>
<p class=""line"">Peel the skin tenderly, not to tear the meat.</p>
<p class=""line"">Chew the skin, suck it,</p>
<p class=""line"">and swallow. Now, eat</p>
<p class=""line"">the meat of the fruit,</p>
<p class=""line"">so sweet,</p>
<p class=""line"">all of it, to the heart.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Donna undresses, her stomach is white.</p>
<p class=""line"">In the yard, dewy and shivering</p>
<p class=""line"">with crickets, we lie naked,</p>
<p class=""line"">face-up, face-down.</p>
<p class=""line"">I teach her Chinese.</p>
<p class=""line"">Crickets: &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<em>chiu chiu</em>. Dew: &emsp;&emsp;I’ve forgotten.</p>
<p class=""line"">Naked: &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I’ve forgotten.</p>
<p class=""line""><em>Ni, wo</em>: &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;you and me.</p>
<p class=""line"">I part her legs,</p>
<p class=""line"">remember to tell her</p>
<p class=""line"">she is beautiful as the moon.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Other words</p>
<p class=""line"">that got me into trouble were</p>
<p class=""line""><em>fight</em> and <em>fright</em>, <em>wren</em> and <em>yarn</em>.</p>
<p class=""line"">Fight was what I did when I was frightened,</p>
<p class=""line"">fright was what I felt when I was fighting.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Wrens are small, plain birds,</p>
<p class=""line"">yarn is what one knits with.</p>
<p class=""line"">Wrens are soft as yarn.</p>
<p class=""line"">My mother made birds out of yarn.</p>
<p class=""line"">I loved to watch her tie the stuff;</p>
<p class=""line"">a bird, a rabbit, a wee man.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Mrs. Walker brought a persimmon to class</p>
<p class=""line"">and cut it up</p>
<p class=""line"">so everyone could taste</p>
<p class=""line"">a <em>Chinese apple</em>. Knowing</p>
<p class=""line"">it wasn’t ripe or sweet, I didn’t eat</p>
<p class=""line"">but watched the other faces.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">My mother said every persimmon has a sun</p>
<p class=""line"">inside, something golden, glowing,</p>
<p class=""line"">warm as my face.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Once in the cellar, I found two wrapped in newspaper,</p>
<p class=""line"">forgotten and not yet ripe.</p>
<p class=""line"">I took them and set both on my bedroom windowsill,</p>
<p class=""line"">where each morning a cardinal</p>
<p class=""line"">sang, <em>The sun, the sun</em>.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Finally understanding</p>
<p class=""line"">he was going blind,</p>
<p class=""line"">my father sat up all one night</p>
<p class=""line"">waiting for a song, a ghost.</p>
<p class=""line"">I gave him the persimmons,</p>
<p class=""line"">swelled, heavy as sadness,</p>
<p class=""line"">and sweet as love.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">this year, in the muddy lighting</p>
<p class=""line"">of my parents’ cellar, I rummage, looking</p>
<p class=""line"">for something I lost.</p>
<p class=""line"">My father sits on the tired, wooden stairs,</p>
<p class=""line"">black cane between his knees,</p>
<p class=""line"">hand over hand, gripping the handle.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">He’s so happy that I’ve come home.</p>
<p class=""line"">I ask how his eyes are, a stupid question.</p>
<p class=""line""><em>All gone</em>, he answers.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Under some blankets, I find a box.</p>
<p class=""line"">Inside the box I find three scrolls.</p>
<p class=""line"">I sit beside him and untie</p>
<p class=""line"">three paintings by my father:</p>
<p class=""line"">Hibiscus leaf and a white flower.</p>
<p class=""line"">Two cats preening.</p>
<p class=""line"">Two persimmons, so full they want to drop from the cloth.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">He raises both hands to touch the cloth,</p>
<p class=""line"">asks, <em>Which is this?</em></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line""><em>This is persimmons, Father.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line""><em>Oh the feel of the wolftail on the silk,</em></p>
<p class=""line""><em>the strength, the tense</em></p>
<p class=""line""><em>precision in the wrist.</em></p>
<p class=""line""><em>I painted them hundreds of times</em></p>
<p class=""line""><em>eyes closed. These I painted blind.</em></p>
<p class=""line""><em>Some things never leave a person:</em></p>
<p class=""line""><em>sent of the hair of one you love,</em></p>
<p class=""line""><em>the texture of persimmons,</em></p>
<p class=""line""><em>in your palm, the ripe weight.</em></p>

<p></p>
<p class=""line"">To pull the metal splinter from my palm</p>
<p class=""line"">my father recited a story in a low voice.</p>
<p class=""line"">I watched his lovely face and not the blade.</p>
<p class=""line"">Before the story ended, he’d removed</p>
<p class=""line"">the iron sliver I thought I’d die from.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">I can’t remember the tale,</p>
<p class=""line"">but hear his voice still, a well</p>
<p class=""line"">of dark water, a prayer.</p>
<p class=""line"">And I recall his hands,</p>
<p class=""line"">two measures of tenderness</p>
<p class=""line"">he laid against my face,</p>
<p class=""line"">the flames of discipline</p>
<p class=""line"">he raised above my head.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Had you entered that afternoon</p>
<p class=""line"">you would have thought you saw a man</p>
<p class=""line"">planting something in a boy’s palm,</p>
<p class=""line"">a silver tear, a tiny flame.</p>
<p class=""line"">Had you followed that boy</p>
<p class=""line"">you would have arrived here,</p>
<p class=""line"">where I bend over my wife’s right hand.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Look how I shave her thumbnail down</p>
<p class=""line"">so carefully she feels no pain.</p>
<p class=""line"">Watch as I lift the splinter out.</p>
<p class=""line"">I was seven when my father</p>
<p class=""line"">took my hand like this,</p>
<p class=""line"">and I did not hold that shard</p>
<p class=""line"">between my fingers and think,</p>
<p class=""line""><em>Metal that will bury me</em>,</p>
<p class=""line"">christen it Little Assassin,</p>
<p class=""line"">Ore Going Deep for My Heart.</p>
<p class=""line"">And I did not lift up my wound and cry,</p>
<p class=""line""><em>Death visited here!</em></p>
<p class=""line"">I did what a child does</p>
<p class=""line"">when he’s given something to keep.</p>
<p class=""line"">I kissed my father.</p>

<p class=""line"">Beloved,</p>
<p class=""line"" style=""text-align: justify;text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-right: 16px;"">Remember what we used to know: the owl perched in the barn rafters with a kitten dangling from its beak, the summers so dry that the wheat withered underfoot as we walked through the field with ice-cream-coated hands. I remember the day you went crazy with fever and took a hatchet to the hives in the apiary. You stood in the swarm and shouted, “I am the Lord God of all creation!” before your father ran in and cradled you to the house. That night, the doctor dipped bandages in honey and wrapped your welted limbs, while your father read to you from Aesop’s <em>Fables</em>. You opened your mouth and let the doctor reach in with pliers, let him pull one bee after another from under your swollen tongue, and let him hold each corpse—glistened with spit—up to the windowpane, before dropping it in a jar at your bedside. You carried that jar with you always, half-filled with their dried bodies, like kernels of corn. On the last night of summer, we fell asleep in the hayloft. In your dream, you whispered, <em>wake up, O sleeper, rise from the dead</em>. In the morning, the jar was empty, and our eyes were the color of nectar.</p>

The City That Swallowed the Sea,Ryan Teitman,"<p class=""line byline""><em>by <a href=""http://poetry.lib.uidaho.edu/index.php/poets/#teitman"">Ryan Teitman</a></em></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">I want to forget the city that swallowed the sea,</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;where the churches unbreak bread and send old men</p>
<p class=""line"">onto their hymnaled knees, where the streets sing</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;like handbells and the night cracks like a broken bottle</p>
<p class=""line"">crushed under the heel of a priest taking confessions,</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;where the newsmen huddle on a street corner</p>
<p class=""line"">under evening editions while the rain skins</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;their stubbled chins and the creeping asphalt</p>
<p class=""line"">licks at the face of the shoreline still,</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;sipping at the sea, sipping at the salt</p>
<p class=""line"">that steams up from the waves each sweaty night</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;and blankets the shoreline in a tight knit</p>
<p class=""line"">of creamy silt, and I remember the prayers I said,</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;with my knees cupped in sand,</p>
<p class=""line"">how I prayed to the saints for an intercession,</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;how it came like a punch to the blood,</p>
<p class=""line"">wrapped its fingers around the throat of my blood,</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;squeezed the ribs of my blood until I could feel</p>
<p class=""line"">the nicked edges of broken-blood ribs tickling</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;my blood’s tiny lungs, those neat, unfurled sails tacking up</p>
<p class=""line"">and down my veins, and I remember the saint</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;of the city, our patron and the patron of bookkeepers,</p>
<p class=""line"">the patron against lead poisoning, the patron of shims</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;and tambourines, the patron of hiccups and tin whistles,</p>
<p class=""line"">patron of pandemics and against pandemics,</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;of ironworkers and against ironworkers, and I want to forget</p>
<p class=""line"">when I was five, and our teacher told us to draw</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;a picture of ourselves, and I drew the skyline above the sea,</p>
<p class=""line"">said I was changing my name to “The City,”</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;and she leaned in close and said that I would never be</p>
<p class=""line"">the city that swallowed the sea, and my face</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;turned warm, and her breath was the dry hush</p>
<p class=""line"">of the sea as it slides each day from the city,</p>

Curse,Meg Kearney,"<p class=""line byline""><em>by <a href=""http://poetry.lib.uidaho.edu/index.php/poets/#kearney"">Meg Kearney</a></em></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">The difference between a raven and a crow</p>
<p class=""line"">is the intent of their blackness. The crow</p>
<p class=""line"">is a raven’s shadow. The crow is a memory</p>
<p class=""line"">of a raven. Only a raven can transcend</p>
<p class=""line"">the raven to become a prophecy.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">We dream of crows but the raven lands in our bed,</p>
<p class=""line"">wakes us wide-eyed and sweating rivers, rivers</p>
<p class=""line"">of our body’s water running hot between</p>
<p class=""line"">our breasts, hot across our forehead and into</p>
<p class=""line"">our own black hair.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">It’s a river I’m drowning in now, a river</p>
<p class=""line"">fed by my own murder of crows, and I</p>
<p class=""line"">alone can save me. Two thousand years ago</p>
<p class=""line"">perhaps we rescued each other, and a thousand</p>
<p class=""line"">years ago a raven slid between us.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Now here we are, clinging to opposite shores,</p>
<p class=""line"">each reaching a hand out toward the river’s</p>
<p class=""line"">tongue, thinking somehow our tongues</p>
<p class=""line"">might save us this time, break</p>
<p class=""line"">the spell if we could just name it.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">I wish I could talk beyond surviving, beyond</p>
<p class=""line"">breathing, but I have a raven in my mouth,</p>
<p class=""line"">I have a river in my lungs and no name</p>
<p class=""line"">is coming to me, only blackness, the lateness</p>
<p class=""line"">of the hour, the sound of wings beating.</p>

Bonsai,Meg Kearney,"<p class=""line byline""><em>by <a href=""http://poetry.lib.uidaho.edu/index.php/poets/#kearney"">Meg Kearney</a></em></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">You carry the tree home to me</p>
<p class=""line"">like a baby from a house about</p>
<p class=""line"">to burn. It was the potential</p>
<p class=""line"">for fire that drew me to you,</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">though now, as you hand over</p>
<p class=""line"">this gift I’ve longed for, I</p>
<p class=""line"">worry if I can share my life</p>
<p class=""line"">with something else so needy.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">I study the instruction book: direct</p>
<p class=""line"">light, lots of water, human breath,</p>
<p class=""line"">and, every day, hands placed on</p>
<p class=""line"">the moss at the base of the trunk.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Touch. Talk. I can do this. I am</p>
<p class=""line"">determined this tree will live,</p>
<p class=""line"">though when I discover aphids, tufts</p>
<p class=""line"">of cotton caught in the leaves</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">like tiny laundry blown by a storm,</p>
<p class=""line"">I panic, pick up the phone —</p>
<p class=""line"">I am not afraid to say I need</p>
<p class=""line"">help. The woman at the nursery</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">calms me: This happens, she says. Don’t</p>
<p class=""line"">worry so much. I try — yet spraying</p>
<p class=""line"">insecticide, I think if junipers had eyes,</p>
<p class=""line"">this one would be crying like a child</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">in the tub. I’m told I did the same</p>
<p class=""line"">as a baby — screamed as my mother</p>
<p class=""line"">scrubbed my face raw, baffled by</p>
<p class=""line"">the indelible dirt on my cheeks</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">until my sister, to my rescue,</p>
<p class=""line"">realized they were freckles.</p>
<p class=""line"">My mother never had a child</p>
<p class=""line"">with freckles until I came along,</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">as I never had a bonsai with brown</p>
<p class=""line"">spot — another phone call and soon I’m</p>
<p class=""line"">mixing vitamins, spraying for lush color,</p>
<p class=""line"">praying for leaves that spring back</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">when squeezed between forefinger and thumb.</p>
<p class=""line"">When I must go away, I call long-distance —</p>
<p class=""line"">Is it drinking enough, getting lots of sun?</p>
<p class=""line"">Don’t leave it in the sink unattended;</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">it likes to be read to. I need you to say</p>
<p class=""line"">everything is going to be all right,</p>
<p class=""line"">say the tree is fine. Your voice across</p>
<p class=""line"">the wire is a rain I’ve needed</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">for years; I tilt back my head,</p>
<p class=""line"">softening into a girl only you have</p>
<p class=""line"">recognized. The tree’s body contains</p>
<p class=""line"">what I can’t yet explain.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">When I am home, you pick me up, carry</p>
<p class=""line"">me to the bedroom. Your skin smells</p>
<p class=""line"">faintly of juniper. We burst in a heat</p>
<p class=""line"">so green it singes my eyelashes.</p>

<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Terror is a mirror in which your eyes belong</p>
<p class=""line"">to a woman wearing sunglasses. There she is</p>
<p class=""line"">now, pulling out of the parking lot across</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">the street in a new convertible, bottle</p>
<p class=""line"">of Cabernet brooding like a teenager</p>
<p class=""line"">in the front seat. Longing is that bottle</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">of wine you may never open. But there is</p>
<p class=""line"">the woman again, lighting a cigarette</p>
<p class=""line"">on the corner of Sixth and Twelfth.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">St. Vincent wraps a shadow around her</p>
<p class=""line"">shoulders as she flicks the cigarette</p>
<p class=""line"">onto the ground and ducks into the dark</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">of Fat Tuesday’s. You have spent years</p>
<p class=""line"">following this woman across the city,</p>
<p class=""line"">gathering her cigarette butts</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">and stuffing them into your mouth.</p>
<p class=""line"">Longing is a form of terror. It is</p>
<p class=""line"">the same woman hovering over postcards</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">in a small White Mountain town. First</p>
<p class=""line"">you are surprised she has anyone</p>
<p class=""line"">to write home to. Then you realize maybe</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">she’s been following you. But that’s</p>
<p class=""line"">impossible. Because this is your</p>
<p class=""line"">mother. She abandoned you long ago.</p>

History,Richard Garcia,"<p class=""line byline""><em>by <a href=""http://poetry.lib.uidaho.edu/index.php/poets/#garcia"">Richard Garcia</a></em></p>
<p></p>
<p align=justify>&emsp;&emsp;The wobbly ceiling fan threatens to decapitate the poetry workshop. They write quickly and nervously. Poetry, the instructor says, is fraught with happenstance and danger. Night in the American South, but the weather, apparently misdirected, has arrived from the Arabian Desert. History enters the room, when Lila, writing about a silk dress, remembers her childless grandfather, tailor to the Shah of Iran. He had laughed at the Shah, there on his knees with his nephews. The Shah, angry, gave him one week to find a second wife who could bear children. Or else. Now Lila sits writing about silk flowing through her grandfather’s hands. The ceiling fan shakes like an airplane forcing its way through the wind.</p>

The Case of the Disappearing Blondes,Richard Garcia,"<p class=""line byline""><em>by <a href=""http://poetry.lib.uidaho.edu/index.php/poets/#garcia"">Richard Garcia</a></em></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"" style=""text-indent:2em; margin:0px;"">Blondes are disappearing from the world. Just yesterday, one sat cross-legged on my desk looking all blonde and dangerous. She was staring at her nails, which were painted deep blue. She seemed just about to speak when she disappeared, leaving her fox stole behind, its little glass eyes staring up at me.
<p class=""line"" style=""text-indent:2em; margin:0px;"">My red-headed wife confesses she’s a blonde. And her name is not really Katherine, but Linda. That’s OK, I never knew my first wife’s real name until I was walking out the door with my golf clubs slung over my shoulder, while the cabdriver, claiming the right of salvage, gathered my neckties from the front lawn.
<p class=""line""  style=""text-indent:2em; margin:0px;"">In a country where there are no blondes, even fake blondes can make big trouble. My wife, looking over my shoulder as I write this, says, You’ve never had a lawn, you don’t golf, and you don’t even know how to tie a necktie. Go color your roots, I say, the blonde is showing through.
<p class=""line"" style=""text-indent:2em; margin:0px;"">The government of Sweden has convened an emergency session. Icelandic police are gathering up Icelandic blondes and taking them to an undisclosed location. Back at the office I lean back in my chair. I wonder why it’s only blonde women who are disappearing. I open up the newspaper: no more blondes in Minnesota.
<p class=""line"" style=""text-indent:2em; margin:0px;"">I look through the files in my computer. Blondes are disappearing from my poems: the one who had tried to poison me with developer fluid; the one I ran over with a motorcycle; the one who was last seen in the Amazon jungle smearing mud on her body that contained flecks of gold; the one who tempted me to follow her out into the rain when I was in bed with the flu.</p>
<p class=""line"" style=""text-indent:2em; margin:0px;"">Just then my wife, roots freshly dyed copper-red, strides into my office. She sits on my desk as if she owns the place. Stares at her cobalt nails.</p>

<p></p>
<p align=justify>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;There was a man who slept on his back in the sand with his arms raised to the sky. My arms are the twin towers, he thought, attempting to resist a dream. My feet are Babylon. My stomach is where snipers hide. There was a man who came to rescue the people. Oh really, said the people. Let us greet you with arms full of flowers. With arms. There was a man who lived in a tower, most disturbed by bees, by corrosive mold and dusty rust. By loving couples, strangers exchanging portraits in the dark, immune to peeling paint, curtains sailing about in the wind mimicking fog. We are embedded in the fog, said one stranger to another. It was dawn over Baghdad, but neither stranger believed in light.</p>

<p class=""line"">And everyone who’s trusted me</p>

<p class=""line""><p></p></p>
<p class=""line""><p class=""line"">I haven’t read one book about</p>

New Prose About an Old Poem,Russell Edson,"<p class=""line byline""><em>by <a href=""http://poetry.lib.uidaho.edu/index.php/poets/#edson"">Russell Edson</a></em></p>
<p></p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;One day an old poem is carried away by the wind. Its poet is relieved, now he won’t have to be nice to it anymore.<br />
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The poem was always too good to throw away, yet, not good enough to publish.<br />
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It lived with him demanding to be reconsidered every so often.<br />
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;But, even so, he sees that he’s not to be rid of the old poem, the wind in reverse has returned it to his desk.<br />
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The old poem is glad to be home, and wants to be read again.<br />
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The poet reads it and realizes once again that it’s too good to be thrown away. Perhaps, he thinks, he’ll send it out in the next mail, knowing, of course, that he won’t; and that he’ll have to go on being nice to it for the rest of his life. . . .</p>

<p class=""line"">to the Quantum Physics Store to buy magnets.</p>
<p class=""line"">He told me his intentions. He was wearing</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">a jumpsuit with frayed cuffs. I thought the cuffs</p>
<p class=""line"">got that way from him rubbing them against</p>
<p class=""line"">his lips but he said they got that way</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">with age. We had two more blocks to walk.</p>
<p class=""line"">“Once I do this, what are you going to do?”</p>
<p class=""line"">he asked. “I wish you wouldn’t do it,” I said.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Big Logos bought the magnets and a crane</p>
<p class=""line"">delivered them to his house. After he built</p>
<p class=""line"">the 900-megahertz superconductor, I couldn’t go</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">to his house anymore because I have all kinds</p>

<p class=""line"">you wonder how she lives with herself.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">I wouldn’t mind. I would commodify</p>

<p></p>
<p class=""line"">I can’t stand political poetry.</p>
<p class=""line"">She never writes about it critically.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">If it really concerns her, she should</p>
<p class=""line"">just write an article or something.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">I heard she’s not that smart. My friend</p>
<p class=""line"">was in class with her and he said</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">actually she’s not that smart.</p>
<p class=""line"">I believe it. I mean the kind of language</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">she uses, so simple, elementary.</p>
<p class=""line"">My friend said she actually believes</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">her poems have speakers. Oh, that’s rich.</p>
<p class=""line"">I’m sorry but if the book is called</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line""><em>amputee</em> and you’re an <em>amputee</em>
<p class=""line"">then you are the speaker.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">So New Criticism. Really I don’t like</p>
<p class=""line"">her work at all. I find it lacking.</p>

<p class=""line"">the Firefox, his face on his body</p>

<p class=""line"">You both grab hold of your machines.</p>
<p class=""line"">You show your eyeballs to each other,</p>

<p class=""line"">as if your eyeballs have not always</p>

The Saint-Girl's Sweetest Tortures,Kathryn Nuernberger,"<p class=""line byline""><em>by <a href=""http://poetry.lib.uidaho.edu/index.php/poets/#nuernberger"">Kathryn Nuernberger</a></em></p>
<p></p>
<p>The saint-girl remains careful not to want, to keep the heat low and drink un-caffeinated tea with her mittens on. Even when the tiny, infesting devils hurtle their pitchforks across her kitchen counter. To peel a peach is a violence she grieves in a small flame of devil-whipped silence. They grieve nothing, especially not acetic middle age or perpetual girlhood or self-imposed naïveté. Without shame they skip, sopping wet and dripping peach, all over the piano keys, spark their nervy little tails in sockets, fornicate in cereal bowls. Adult and handsome devils, ram-faced with pearlescent horns, graze past her mailbox to scratch their thorn-tipped tails along her letters like a match.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A moment of weakness: “Could you please whisper your perversities more quietly?” she rages as they blink her lights and wave glowsticks. Her novel of manners hits the floor. “No more about red lips or cocks. I’m trying to edify my human spirit.” The devils feign timidity and purr apologies around her legs. And now satisfaction is a sulfur in her stomach. She holds herself out to the smallest one, who had been leaking crocodile tears in the tea cup. His suckling stings a little pleasure, but maybe, she thinks, it is not wrong to nurse your demons until you bleed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The devils were mosquitoes then in her ear – <em>Why can’t you? Why can’t you?</em> To answer is to swallow one by mistake. <em>Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?</em> Her larynx itches with capitulation. <em>Dimpled devil apples of my eye</em>.</p>

<p></p>
<p>A Man is a flesh monster with a mouthful of teeth in his scrotum. Haven’t you seen the mouth of a man? I know it’s there because when a man told me he thought my vagina had teeth, I wondered how a person could come to think such a thing.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When I love a man it’s like watching a wrestling match on the beach. We’re standing at the rope and there are our mouths jaw-locked and tussling like badgers without bodies.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A Man called me a man-hater once. I didn’t hate men before, but I did after. Before, a man made me dolorous, now A Man is invigorating. Thanks, I thank you for this.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There was a time when A Man called me a man-eater. I am very fond of that appellation. You have no idea.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Even though people talk about rape as a matter of course, I was a woman with eye teeth before I understood that they might be talking about me. A Man on the front porch of a frat called out, “Why don’t you come up here and get raped!” A Man laughed. A Man waited for another woman to walk on the sidewalk. A Man tried his joke again. “Why don’t you come up here and get raped!” A Man thinks he’s clever.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A Man is staggering out of the bar on game day to catcall me across the street and then he is answering the aggression of my old-lady scolding glare with a hand pumping his own crotch. A Man walking next to me on game day gets so hung up on his personal experiences that he desperately wants to explain this misbehavior as boyish and age-appropriate. A Man can’t get his mind around the fact that I do not care to give a fuck about A Man again, beyond figuring out how to make him and his friends feel a shame so great they start to wonder if they aren’t fourteen-year-old girls sent by the teacher to the confessional because of a list found in some boy’s locker.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Ever since I started itching for A Man passing me on the street to say “Smile, honey” just one more time, men have taken up demure nodding. A Man can tell when a woman is looking for an opportunity.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A Man is candid. A Man is live-action. A Man thinks he doesn’t have a fleshy hairball of teeth. But I can hear them clicking down there. A Man thinks he knows where he’s keeping his tongue. It’s not for me to argue with A Man about where he imagines he’s put it.</p>

<p class=""line"">My nipples are brown now.</p>
<p class=""line"">One way to describe me is mouse-</p>
<p class=""line"">like. Like fur on the one decapitated</p>
<p class=""line"">in the silverware drawer this morning.</p>
<p class=""line"">Once we set a trap for a mouse</p>
<p class=""line"">so fat the hinge could do no more</p>
<p class=""line"">than pinch his neck contorted.</p>
<p class=""line"">for hours he clinked around the spoons.</p>
<p class=""line"">If you survive your own execution,</p>
<p class=""line"">the only justice is that you be permitted</p>
<p class=""line"">to walk away with your decapitated</p>
<p class=""line"">head in your hands, as Saint Denis did,</p>
<p class=""line"">up the hill into the chapel of the rest</p>
<p class=""line"">of his life, where we would come</p>
<p class=""line"">to eat sandwiches on a bench,</p>
<p class=""line"">holding hands as we would when we took</p>
<p class=""line"">the mouse to a grassy lot in the alley</p>
<p class=""line"">behind the First Presbyterian.</p>
<p class=""line"">Because a hawk noticed and became</p>
<p class=""line"">restless on his branch, we stood guard</p>
<p class=""line"">watching the mouse try to organize</p>
<p class=""line"">himself. It’s disgusting to touch</p>
<p class=""line"">a rodent, so we used tongs to straighten</p>
<p class=""line"">the sideways spine trapped so</p>
<p class=""line"">unaccountably wrong. The fat creature</p>
<p class=""line"">limped himself into the yellow grass</p>
<p class=""line"">and further, the bird moved on,</p>
<p class=""line"">and we went home to dinner happy,</p>
<p class=""line"">knowing happy for the mouse was</p>
<p class=""line"">unlikely, but then so was Denis—</p>
<p class=""line"">how wide-eyed he must have been!</p>
<p class=""line"">When I told Brian about my nipples,</p>
<p class=""line"">he told me a little joke: A boy was in</p>
<p class=""line"">a terrible accident. He finally woke</p>
<p class=""line"">in the hospital and cried, “Doctor!</p>
<p class=""line"">I can’t feel my legs!” The doctor</p>
<p class=""line"">was reassuring, “Of course you can’t.</p>
<p class=""line"">We had to amputate your arms.”</p>

<p class=""line"">I encoded had escaped and moved on. I was</p>

<p class=""line"">You, dear Brenda, are at home</p>
<p class=""line"">with our son, whose remarkable</p>
<p class=""line"">days have him laughing</p>
<p class=""line"">like any kid he isn’t. When</p>
<p class=""line"">we made him out of the wish</p>
<p></p></p>
<p class=""line""><p class=""line"">to make him, we knew nothing</p>
<p class=""line"">except our own parents couldn’t be</p>
<p class=""line"">close or far enough.</p>
<p class=""line"">Our son can’t run, which may</p>
<p class=""line"">be our fault, we’ll never know,</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">like sitting on separate daggers.</p>
<p class=""line"">Love is the need to escape</p>
<p class=""line"">the beloved, isn’t it? So you can</p>
<p class=""line"">pretend you can’t cause any pain?</p>
<p class=""line"">It’s a mutation of guilt, isn’t it?</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">I hide beneath sheets, close</p>
<p class=""line"">to your belly, and apologize</p>
<p class=""line"">&#8212;to you, to my mother, to our son,</p>
<p class=""line"">to motherhood and fatherhood,</p>
<p class=""line"">to all those now fleeing</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">what they love. It’s grotesque,</p>
<p class=""line"">but I will cough something up,</p>
<p class=""line"">a bloody string of self, to tie</p>
<p class=""line"">you to me, me to him, him to you,</p>
<p class=""line"">then we can all go our ways,</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">separate or not, or nowhere, and pluck</p>
<p class=""line"">that string, feel each other</p>
<p class=""line"">tensing, teasing the other end.</p>
<p class=""line"">You may not understand&#8212;I don’t</p>
<p class=""line"">either&#8212;but someday we might:</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Someday shines on families like light.</p>

Be Always Late,Cecilia Woloch,"<p class=""line byline""><em>by <a href=""http://poetry.lib.uidaho.edu/index.php/poets/#woloch"">Cecilia Woloch</a></em></p>
<p></p>
<p align=center>—<em>after Baudelaire</em></p> 
<p></p>
<p align=justify>One should always be late. One should always be running/half-running in high-heeled boots through the streets with the church bells ringing the hour one should have already arrived. And be still en route, still a bridge away, still a sliver of silvery river to go. One should have clouds at one’s shoulders like breath, panting clouds and a gasp of wind at the nape of the neck to keep one cool. The heart should be clicking against the ribs: <em>I’m late, I’m late, I’m late</em>. One should be turning just then past the church, past evening beginning in every cafe, past the poor little park with its late little flowers, disheveled little flames. Because somewhere someone waits. Because somewhere one has already arrived and will never rush past this again. One’s self with one’s coat like a black sky flung; one’s own shadow flaring out behind. And the sound of those bells in one’s hair, in one’s bones. Now and ever. Not never: late.</p>

<p class=""line"">the more than occasional cigarette,</p>
<p class=""line"">an almost unquenchable thirst to be kissed,</p>

<p></p>
<p>On a panel of men who spoke about history & poetry, she sat quietly for much of it. They, the men, were saying strong things, good things but in authoritative voices, voices that knew they knew things. & she remained the only quiet one. She listened as if she weren’t listening. Her face looked forward. Her quiet seemed distant. It had a straight back. & then she interrupted one of the men & said something like, <br/>“That reminds me of the time…” & she spoke of a fellow Native American teacher in her region who committed suicide near the end of one of the years, & how he must have been hurting & isolated & in pain, but not many people spoke about that, or spoke about his death or their loss when he died. It was swept under the rug, that was the phrase she used, & she said she was at home one day & looking out of the window & she noticed a black thread or string there, floating in the frame, & she observed it for a while, floating there, until she realized that that black string was grief. The grief of the professor, the grief of the students, her own grief, the grief of silence, a historical grief, & that she knew that it was her job to take that thread & put it somewhere, weave it into the larger tapestry (she made a gesture, then, as if that tapestry were just above her head). She said it was her job to put that grief in its place, or else someone else, some child or grown person would be out walking & just walk right into it, without knowing what it was they’d walked into, what they had, then, inherited in a way, what they were, then, carrying & feeling. The danger of that. The grief of that. & that was what she said about poetry & history. & that is all I remember from all of the things that were said that entire day.</p>

The Widow's Yard,Isabella Gardner,"<p class=""line byline""><em>by <a href=""http://poetry.lib.uidaho.edu/index.php/poets/#gardner"">Isabella Gardner</a></em></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line""><em>For Myra</em></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">“Snails lead slow idyllic lives . . .”</p>
<p class=""line"">The rose and the laurel leaves</p>
<p class=""line"">in the raw young widow’s yard</p>
<p class=""line"">were littered with silver. Hard-</p>
<p class=""line"">ly a leaf lacked the decimal scale</p>
<p class=""line"">of the self of a snail. Frail</p>
<p class=""line"">in friendship I observed with care</p>
<p class=""line"">these creatures (meaning to spare</p>
<p class=""line"">the widow’s vulnerable eyes</p>
<p class=""line"">the hurting pity in my gaze).</p> 
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Snails, I said, are tender skinned.</p>
<p class=""line"">Excess in nature. . . sun rain wind</p>
<p class=""line"">are killers. To save themselves</p>
<p class=""line"">snails shrink to shelter in their shells</p>
<p class=""line"">where they wait safe and patient</p>
<p class=""line"">until the elements are gent-</p>
<p class=""line"">er. And do they not have other foes?</p>
<p class=""line"">the widow asked. Turtles crows</p>
<p class=""line"">foxes rats, I replied, and canned</p>
<p class=""line"">heat that picnickers aband-</p>
<p class=""line"">on. Also parasites invade</p>
<p class=""line"">their flesh and alien eggs are laid</p>
<p class=""line"">inside their skins. Their mating</p>
<p class=""line"">too is perilous, The meeting</p>
<p class=""line"">turns their faces blue with bliss</p>
<p class=""line"">and consummation of this</p>
<p class=""line"">absolute embrace is so</p>
<p class=""line"">extravagantly slow</p>
<p class=""line"">in coming that love begun</p>
<p class=""line"">at dawn may end in fatal sun.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">The widow told me that her</p>
<p class=""line"">husband knew snails’ ways and his gar-</p>
<p class=""line"">den had been Eden for them. He</p>
<p class=""line"">said the timid snail could lift three</p>
<p class=""line"">times his weight straight up and haul</p>
<p class=""line"">a wagon toy loaded with a whole</p>
<p class=""line"">two hundred times his body’s burden.</p>
<p class=""line"">Then as we left the garden</p>
<p class=""line"">she said that at the first faint chill</p>
<p class=""line"">the first premonition of fall</p>
<p class=""line"">the snails go straight to earth . . . excrete</p>
<p class=""line"">the lime with which they then secrete</p>
<p class=""line"">the opening in their shells . . . and wait for spring.</p>
<p class=""line"">It is those little doors which sing,</p>
<p class=""line"">she said, when they are boiled.</p>
<p class=""line"">She smiled at me when I recoiled.</p>

<p class=""line"">The salmon west leapt soft, spawned wild to sunset,</p>
<p class=""line"">and the poaching lovers stood heron-still in the foam</p>
<p class=""line"">of the orchard, baited to catch some sound of home,</p>
<p class=""line"">while no dog barked and no door slammed and no child shouted.</p>
<p class=""line"">But poplar leaves clashed like cymbals in the thin wind that blew</p>
<p class=""line"">and at last the moon boomed out of the apple-tree and the two</p>
<p class=""line"">lovers drove into the amorous dusk</p>
<p class=""line"">and swam like swans through the clamorous air.</p>

<p class=""line"">It comes from that voice dogs can hear, the glass-</p>
<p class=""line"">breaking high C that makes life sylphlike. </p>
<p class=""line"">Of course sylphlike’s</p>
<p></p>

<p class=""line"">I don’t want to dance: I want to be lithe, </p>

<p class=""line"">I have never cast the petulance aside, </p>
<p class=""line"">not even just sat with that humlessness. </p>
<p class=""line"">Can I call that my own personal abyss?</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">I’m not exempt, I’m no special case, I won’t </p>
<p class=""line"">go around with scissors and a razor blade, </p>
<p class=""line"">cutting into things, inspecting, shutting down</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">the operation. I don’t want to say nimbus </p>

<p class=""line"">Ok, it’s sunny, otherworldly, skin-tight</p>
<p class=""line"">where we’re flabby and clouded over, pining away</p>
<p class=""line"">under layers of jealousy, detachment, the compost heap</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">of the shucked and dismissed. Out of the bad deeds,</p>
<p class=""line"">screeches in the arboretum, the wronged person</p>
<p class=""line"">who circles the rotaries, the infidel</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">who torments her clitoris, the young man</p>
<p class=""line"">who discovers he’s nameless,</p>
<p class=""line"">muttering when he should be moaning, shattering</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">the window of opportunity because—I forget where</p>
<p class=""line"">I was going with this—perhaps the baffling</p>
<p class=""line"">cataclysmic lesions that scar us invisibly—</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">but I suspect, deep down, we’re a good people,</p>
<p class=""line"">easily humbled: we implore, fill with worry,</p>
<p class=""line"">we try to sing to loved ones, shadow</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">their wishes, color their hair as they fly</p>
<p class=""line"">into the great nothing: no more, that’s it.</p>
<p class=""line"">But we can only hold the shell of them,</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">get on our knees and scrub away</p>
<p class=""line"">the whole heavy saga. In another world,</p>
<p class=""line"">people would know exactly how bad we are,</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">how we seize a dance floor, how we shake</p>
<p class=""line"">and sweat profusely, how we hum a few bars</p>
<p class=""line"">through the dead spots, and since we have no idea</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">what comes next, we set the homestead</p>
<p class=""line"">ablaze. We bargain, we finagle,</p>
<p class=""line"">we comb the hair on the corpses, their beautiful hair.</p>

<p class=""line"">My first roses brought me to my senses.</p>
<p class=""line"">All my furies, I launched them like paper boats</p>
<p class=""line"">in the algaed pond behind my house.</p>
<p></p>

<p class=""line"">You could be merciless trimming them back.</p>
<p class=""line"">You could be merciless and I needed that.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Emerald green with crimson tips,</p>
<p class=""line"">these were no crowns of thorns.</p>
<p class=""line"">They would not portend nor intimate.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">But if you fed them they’d branch out:</p>
<p class=""line"">two generations in a single summer.</p>
<p class=""line"">One had a scent of fruit & violet, the other</p>

<p class=""line"">Letters are trees.</p>
<p class=""line"">Behind them something</p>

<p class=""line"">Not a nice one, perhaps. Not like</p>

<p class=""line"">I crave the aftersilence. Angry buzz as night falls:</p>

<p class=""line"">It is beautiful. It is almost fearfully beautiful.</p>
<p class=""line"">It is most fearsomely beautiful. I am still thinking, I am still waiting</p>

<p></p>
<p class=""line"">When my friend lost her little finger</p>
<p class=""line"">between the rollers of a printing press,</p>
<p class=""line"">I hadn’t met her yet. It must have taken</p>
<p class=""line"">months for the stump to heal, skin stretched</p>
<p class=""line"">and stitched over bone, must have taken</p>
<p class=""line"">years before she could consider it calmly,</p>
<p class=""line"">as she does now in an airport café</p>
<p class=""line"">over a cup of black coffee.</p>
<p class=""line"">She doesn’t complain or blame the unguarded</p>
<p class=""line"">machine, the noise of the factory, the job</p>
<p class=""line"">with its long unbroken hours.</p>
<p class=""line"">She simply opens her damaged hand and studies</p>
<p class=""line"">the emptiness, the loss</p>
<p class=""line"">of symmetry and flesh, and tells me</p>
<p class=""line"">it was a small price to pay,</p>
<p class=""line"">that her missing finger taught her</p>
<p class=""line"">to take more care with her life,</p>
<p class=""line"">with what she reaches out</p>
<p class=""line"">to touch, to stay awake when she’s awake</p>
<p class=""line"">and listen, to pay attention</p>
<p class=""line"">to what’s turning in the world.</p>

<p></p>
<p class=""line"">His voice, toward the end, was a soft coal breaking</p>
<p class=""line"">open in the little stove of his heart. One day</p>
<p class=""line"">he just let go and the birds stopped singing. 
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">then the other deaths came on, as if by permission—</p>
<p class=""line"">beloved teacher, cousin, a lover slipped from my life</p>
<p class=""line"">the way a rope slithers from your grip, the ocean</p>
<p class=""line"">folding over it, your fingers stripped of flesh. A deck</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">of cards worn smooth at a kitchen table, the jack</p>
<p class=""line"">of spades laid down at last, his face thumbed to threads.</p>
<p class=""line"">An ashtray full of pebbles on the window ledge, wave-beaten,</p>
<p class=""line"">gathered at day’s end from a beach your mind has never left,</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">then a starling climbs the pine outside—</p>
<p class=""line"">the cat’s black paw, the past shattered, the stones</p>
<p class=""line"">rolled to their forever-hidden places. Even the poets</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">I had taken to my soul: Levis, Matthews, Levertov—</p>
<p class=""line"">the books of poetry, lost or stolen, left on airport benches,</p>
<p class=""line"">shabby trade paperbacks of my childhood, the box</p>
<p class=""line"">misplaced, the one suitcase that mattered crushed</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">to nothing in the belly of a train. I took a rubbing</p>
<p class=""line"">of the carved wings and lilies from a headstone</p>
<p class=""line"">outside Philadelphia, frosted gin bottles</p>
<p class=""line"">stationed like soldiers on her grave:</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line""><em>The Best Blues Singer in the World</em></p>
<p class=""line""><em>Will Never Stop Singing.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">How many losses does it take to stop a heart,</p>
<p class=""line"">to lay waste to the vocabularies of desire?</p>
<p class=""line"">Each one came rushing through the rooms he left.</p>
<p class=""line"">Mouths open. Last words flown up into the trees.</p>

<p class=""line"">I loved him most</p>
<p class=""line"">when he came home from work,</p>
<p class=""line"">his fingers still curled from fitting pipe,</p>
<p class=""line"">his denim shirt ringed with sweat,</p>
<p class=""line"">smelling of salt, the drying weeds</p>
<p class=""line"">of the ocean. I’d go to where he sat</p>
<p class=""line"">on the edge of the bed, his forehead</p>
<p class=""line"">anointed with grease, his cracked hands</p>
<p class=""line"">jammed between his thighs, and unlace</p>
<p class=""line"">the steel-toed boots, stroke his ankles</p>
<p class=""line"">and calves, the pads and bones of his feet.</p>
<p class=""line"">Then I’d open his clothes and take</p>
<p class=""line"">the whole day inside me—the ship’s</p>
<p class=""line"">gray sides, the miles of copper pipe,</p>
<p class=""line"">the voice of the foreman clanging</p>
<p class=""line"">off the hull’s silver ribs. Spark of lead</p>
<p class=""line"">kissing metal. The clamp, the winch,</p>
<p class=""line"">the white fire of the torch, the whistle,</p>
<p class=""line"">and the long drive home.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify; max-width:16em;"">Witness this: peonies and roses on the bedspread. Her red dress. The motel curtains sliding together to cover their view of parking lot oil stains and cigarette butts, the billboard that asks How Will The Falls Transform You? Their bodies give way, unresolved and stumbling. Afterwards, he stands in the rented doorframe listening to her shifting, her breath. In the half-melting drifts. In the creak of the car door before the slam. And how she breathes, like an accordion or a jewel box, and the sky opens. It’s not the first time he prays for wonders instead of happiness. Cave of the Winds. Maid of the Mist. Rushing torrents of neon bouncing off the pavement between gaps in the motel curtains: aperture of plastic, chrome, electric light. Love is thrown and it is caught. It lives a long time in the air, floats on the surface of the skin. It can overflow, bounce like a fiddle string. It can be blurred, shaped like an onion peel. The half-moon of her body in this stained place, vertiginous. He hasn’t written these words in a long time. He writes them with the motel pen. <em>If there was an apartment and I had a decent job and you felt happy and thought there could be a nice history together, would you come home?</em></p>

Big Box Encounter,Erika Meitner,"<p class=""line byline""><em>by <a href=""http://poetry.lib.uidaho.edu/index.php/poets/#meitner"">Erika Meitner</a></em></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">My student sends letters to me with the lights turned low.</p>
<p class=""line"">They feature intricate vocabulary, like <em>soporific</em> and <em>ennui</em>.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Like <em>intervening</em> and <em>kinetic</em> and <em>tumult</em>. He strings words together</p>
<p class=""line"">like he’s following a difficult knitting pattern. He is both more</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">and less striking without a shirt on. I know this from the time</p>
<p class=""line"">I ran into him at Walmart buying tiki torches and margarita mix</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">and, flustered, I studied the white floor tiles, the blue plastic</p>
<p class=""line"">shopping cart handle, while he told me something that turned</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">to white noise and I tried not to look at his beautiful terrible chest,</p>
<p class=""line"">the V-shaped wings of his chiseled hipbones. I write him back.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">I tell him there are two horses outside my window and countless weeds.</p>
<p class=""line"">I tell him that the train comes by every other hour and rattles the walls.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">But how to explain my obsession with destruction? Not self-immolation,</p>
<p class=""line"">but more of a disintegration, slow, like Alka-Seltzer in water. Like sugar in water.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">I dissolve. He writes <em>enthralling</em>. He writes <em>epiphany</em> and <em>coffee</em> machine.</p>
<p class=""line"">He is working in an office, which might as well be outer space.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">I am in the mountains. The last time I worked in an office, he was ten.</p>
<p class=""line"">I was a typewriter girl. I was a maternity-leave replacement for a fancy secretary.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">I helped sell ads at TV Guide. I was fucking a guy who lived in a curtain-free studio</p>
<p class=""line"">above a neon BAR sign on Ludlow Street and all night we were bathed in pot smoke</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">and flickering electric pink light. Here, the sun goes down in the flame</p>
<p class=""line"">of an orange heat-wave moon. The train thrums and rattles the distance,</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">and I think of his chest with the rounded tattoo in one corner and my youth,</p>
<p class=""line"">the hollows of his hipbones holding hard, big-box fluorescent light.</p>

<p></p>
<p class=""line"">For Aciek Arok Deng</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">I leave the camp, unable to breathe,</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">me Freud girl, after her interior,</p>
<p class=""line"">she ""Lost Girl,"" after my purse,</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">her face:</p>
<p class=""line"">dark as eggplant,</p>
<p class=""line"">her gaze:</p>
<p class=""line"">unpinnable, untraceable,</p>
<p class=""line"">floating, open, defying the gravity</p>
<p class=""line"">I was told keeps pain in place.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Maybe trauma doesn’t harden,</p>
<p class=""line"">packed tight as sediment at the bottom of her psyche,</p>
<p class=""line"">dry and cracked as the desert she crossed,</p>
<p class=""line"">maybe memory doesn’t stalk her</p>
<p class=""line"">with its bulging eyes.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Once inside the body, does war move up or down?</p>
<p class=""line"">Maybe the body pisses it out,</p>
<p class=""line"">maybe it dissipates, like sweat and fog</p>
<p class=""line"">under the heat of yet another colonial God?</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">In America, we say, ""Tell us your story, Lost Girl</p>
<p class=""line"">you’ll feel lighter,</p>
<p class=""line"">it’s the memories you must expel,</p>
<p class=""line"">the bumpy ones, the tortures, the rapes, the burnt huts.""</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">So Aciek brings forth all the war she can muster,</p>
<p class=""line"">and the doctors lay it on a table, like a stillbirth,</p>
<p class=""line"">and pick through the sharpest details</p>
<p class=""line"">bombs, glass, machetes</p>
<p class=""line"">and because she wants to please them</p>
<p class=""line"">she coughs up more and more,</p>
<p class=""line"">dutifully emptying the sticky war</p>
<p class=""line"">like any grateful Lost Girl in America should</p>
<p class=""line"">when faced with a flock of white coats.</p>
<p></p>

<p class=""line"">The phone rings,</p>
<p class=""line"">you’re there, all sun, war and heat.</p>
<p class=""line"">You’ve decided to drive</p>
<p class=""line"">over the Ugandan border,</p>
<p class=""line"">the jeep all rigged&mdash;</p>
<p class=""line"">it’s a done deal,</p>
<p class=""line"">but I beg anyway.</p>
<p class=""line"">Nairobi’s slums burned,</p>
<p class=""line"">ports closed, no gasoline,</p>
<p class=""line"">so you fill up with what you can get,</p>
<p class=""line"">strap the jeep with tools and jerrycans.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">In the morning</p>
<p class=""line"">our daughter hovers at my bedroom door</p>
<p class=""line"">lunar and rumpled,</p>
<p class=""line"">she must have overheard me on the phone</p>
<p class=""line"">pleading.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Silently she assumes her throne</p>
<p class=""line"">over the heater,</p>
<p class=""line"">plots her revolution,</p>
<p class=""line"">the warm air puffing her white nightgown</p>
<p class=""line"">like a Queen Toad.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">She reading me, reading her.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">When her brother Will</p>
<p class=""line"">tries to share her space</p>
<p class=""line"">she jabs him hard in the ribs,</p>
<p class=""line"">anger spilling red down her face and chest.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">And it happens again,</p>
<p class=""line"">whereby war, however diluted, however transformed,</p>
<p class=""line"">however many times removed, has spread,</p>
<p class=""line"">whereby the suffering of Kenya begets Uganda,</p>
<p class=""line"">begets my husband,</p>
<p class=""line"">begets me, begets Ana, begets her brother…</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Later in the mudroom, getting ready for school</p>
<p class=""line"">I see Will kick our tiny old mutt.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Perhaps it will end here, with this dog</p>
<p class=""line"">who pees all over the house,</p>
<p class=""line"">sleeping on the couch all day long,</p>
<p class=""line"">cataracts like clouded moons,</p>
<p class=""line"">for now, noble keeper of the passing flame.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">The school bus arrives,</p>
<p class=""line"">my children chatter,</p>
<p class=""line"">emptied of their small wars</p>
<p class=""line"">they skip lightly toward its open door,</p>
<p class=""line"">the dog limping eagerly behind.</p>

<p class=""line"">Live out to Toivola, skinny woods and bog,</p>
<p class=""line"">Sorry sort of country, overlooked by most,</p>
<p class=""line"">Pioneered by people awful fond of failure.</p>
<p class=""line"">They branch out to Twig, you know, down as far as Esko,</p>
<p class=""line"">Askov, Bruno, over there to Togo, Effie, Emily,</p>
<p class=""line"">Tenstrike, Shooks. Wherever you would never,</p>
<p class=""line"">There you’ll find a Finn.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">They believe in Sauna, Nudity, and Coffee.</p>
<p class=""line"">Their wallpaper is birch bark; their La-Z-Boy’s a stump.</p>
<p class=""line"">The women are good-lookers, the menfolk</p>
<p class=""line"">Not so much. They specialize in blueberries,</p>
<p class=""line"">Hayfields and alders, rocks and pickled pike.</p>
<p class=""line"">They don’t go in for paint much, like a weathered look:</p>
<p class=""line"">Tarpaper buildings, wood piled high . . .</p>
<p class=""line"">Go and introduce yourself. Coffee’s always hot.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Their names are Nordic music, silly and profound,</p>
<p class=""line"">Descended from the polska, calling to the cows,</p>
<p class=""line"">Whittled willow whistles, woodwinds, drums.</p>
<p class=""line"">Names like Ada Aho, Paavo Havumaki,</p>
<p class=""line"">Sulo Saari, Joki Koveroja.</p>
<p class=""line"">Where’d they learn such laughter? Poverty and wolves.</p>
<p class=""line"">Love cries of women. Crooning of the loons.</p>
<p class=""line"">Watching how the crops grow. Here comes the hail.</p>
<p class=""line"">Water makes a big splash; then it runs away.</p>
<p class=""line"">Wind whacks the window, sifts through snow.</p>

<p></p>
<p class=""line"">A maniac for picnicking,</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;She’d pack us up to go</p> 
<p class=""line"">The very first thing in the spring;</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;Sometimes we sat in snow!</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">But we were well into the year;</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;The swans had all long gone.</p> 
<p class=""line"">We’d shed, like leaves, our nagging fears.</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;The lake went pink and calm.</p> 
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Her hair’d come back; her light, low laugh;</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;Her cancer in “remission,”</p> 
<p class=""line"">A state that gave us some relief</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;From pain and vain religion.</p> 
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">My dad had let me start the fire.</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;I saw my mom was proud</p> 
<p class=""line"">Of how the flames kept growing higher;</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;They wouldn’t flicker out.</p> 
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">I’ve clutched this day near fifty years</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;But always felt so stupid</p> 
<p class=""line"">That it could bring the sting of tears</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;When there was nothing to it:</p> 
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">My sister makes a small bouquet</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;Of weeds and faded asters,</p> 
<p class=""line"">But I can’t hear my mother say</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;What she bends low to ask her.</p> 
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">My brother’s down beside the shore;</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;I see his silhouette.</p> 
<p class=""line"">My father calls out, as before,</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;“Now don’t go getting wet!”</p> 
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">My mother leans against a tree.</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;She sighs. I hear her say</p> 
<p class=""line"">Across the half a century,</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;“It’s been a lovely day.”</p>

What Does This Mean?,Barton Sutter,"<p class=""line byline""><em>by <a href=""http://poetry.lib.uidaho.edu/index.php/poets/#sutter"">Barton Sutter</a></em></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">In those days, eighth-grade boys drove cars,</p>
<p class=""line"">Grain trucks, and tractors on the farm,</p>
<p class=""line"">So Dad was only half-surprised</p>
<p class=""line"">The little men he catechized</p>
<p class=""line"">Drove themselves to the village school</p>
<p class=""line"">(Cream and milk, not church and state,</p>
<p class=""line"">Were what they worked to separate)</p>
<p class=""line"">Where he recounted Luther’s rules.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line""><em>Thou shalt have no other gods before me</em>.</p>
<p class=""line"">What does this mean?</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">We lived so near to Canada</p>
<p class=""line"">No one was shocked that Saturday a</p>
<p class=""line"">Black bear loomed outside the glass</p>
<p class=""line"">Where Dad was questioning his class.</p>
<p class=""line"">The kids evacuated, rushed</p>
<p class=""line"">To pickup trucks and beater Fords</p>
<p class=""line"">To chase the bear down gravel roads</p>
<p class=""line"">But lost him in the underbrush.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line""><em>Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s wife,</em></p>
<p class=""line""><em>Nor his manservant, nor his maidservant,</em></p>
<p class=""line""><em>Nor his ox, nor his ass,</em></p>
<p class=""line""><em>Nor anything that is thy neighbor’s.</em></p>
<p class=""line"">What does this mean?</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">My father’s teaching was homespun:</p>
<p class=""line"">Father, Holy Ghost, and Son</p>
<p class=""line"">Were peanuts in a single shell.</p>
<p class=""line"">His ways were easy, slow, soft-sell.</p>
<p class=""line"">To those who could not memorize,</p>
<p class=""line"">He’d feed the answers, phrase by phrase.</p>
<p class=""line"">Some girls would stammer in his gaze,</p>
<p class=""line"">Distracted by his light blue eyes.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line""><em>Thou shalt not commit adultery</em>.</p>
<p class=""line"">What does this mean?</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">They’d work an hour, then take a break</p>
<p class=""line"">For thirty minutes the boys would make</p>
<p class=""line"">The most of, charging through our woods,</p>
<p class=""line"">Chasing rabbits, hot for blood,</p>
<p class=""line"">Armed with pebbles and slingshots,</p>
<p class=""line"">Helter-skelter, crashing brush,</p>
<p class=""line"">With shouts and yelps when one would flush,</p>
<p class=""line"">And then return to talk of God.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line""><em>Thou shalt not kill.</em></p>
<p class=""line"">What does this mean?</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Less than a dozen years before,</p>
<p class=""line"">My father had come back from war,</p>
<p class=""line"">Where many of his friends had died.</p>
<p class=""line"">These churches in the countryside</p>
<p class=""line"">Called him to marry, bury, bless,</p>
<p class=""line"">Ambitionless for wealth or fame.</p>
<p class=""line"">Those few who still recall his name</p>
<p class=""line"">Remember best his gentleness.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line""><em>Honor thy father and thy mother</em></p>
<p class=""line""><em>That thy days may be long upon the land.</em></p>
<p class=""line"">What does this mean?</p>

Sheep Child,Brigit Pegeen Kelly,"<p class=""line byline""><em>by <a href=""http://poetry.lib.uidaho.edu/index.php/poets/#kelly"">Brigit Pegeen Kelly</a></em></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">I wanted a child. What then, this? The sheep</p>
<p class=""line"">Stands dumb behind the fence. Stands dumb.</p>
<p class=""line"">Demanding what? Pity? Affection? A breast full</p>
<p class=""line"">Of milk? He’s up to his neck in his filthy fur.</p>
<p class=""line"">Honey to the flies. Rancid honey. Each coarse</p>
<p class=""line"">Curl dipped in it. The flies reeling. A sullen</p>
<p class=""line"">Moment…Oh, Sheep, Sheep, this is my undoing.</p>
<p class=""line"">That you have a thought and I would read it. I would</p>
<p class=""line"">Put my head up to your smelly head and watch</p>
<p class=""line"">The pretty pictures sliding past: Look! There goes</p>
<p class=""line"">The flowerless larch, lurching over the ground</p>
<p class=""line"">Like a skiff. And that black thing spinning in the dung</p>
<p class=""line"">Is a truck tire stuffed with hay. And here, now,</p>
<p class=""line"">Down from the elm, comes the crow, bully bird</p>
<p class=""line"">Beating and beating the air with his wide wings,</p>
<p class=""line"">As if calling the field to order...There is no order.</p>
<p class=""line"">What day of the week is this? Wash day?</p>
<p class=""line"">Bake day? What hour of what day?...Behind you,</p>
<p class=""line"">Flanked by steely thistle, stands the old goat,</p>
<p class=""line"">Contemptuous, uninterested, gnawing on the last</p>
<p class=""line"">Of a Sunday dress; and “I had a goat once,”</p>
<p class=""line"">The thought that comes to me, “I had a small</p>
<p class=""line"">Black goat, who pounded his head against a tree</p>
<p class=""line"">Until he was dead. His name was Bumblebee...”</p>
<p class=""line"">Well, night is coming on. No it is dead afternoon.</p>
<p class=""line"">But there is something about night in this cloud-</p>
<p class=""line"">Shadowed field. Perhaps the stars are shifting</p>
<p class=""line"">Behind the veil of day? Perhaps. Perhaps...Oh,</p>
<p class=""line"">I would turn this pretty. You see the cowbirds</p>
<p class=""line"">Riding the boney heifer by the overturned bathtub?</p>
<p class=""line"">The birds are dung-colored, yes, but when</p>
<p class=""line"">They rise and swim together they change color,</p>
<p class=""line"">Brown to red, the way the light changes color</p>
<p class=""line"">At dusk. And, yes, the swans by the back fence</p>
<p class=""line"">Are foul-tempered and mean as sin, but look</p>
<p class=""line"">How their necks wave about now like the stems</p>
<p class=""line"">Of lilies in the wind...lilies blowing in the wind...</p>
<p class=""line"">The goat snorts and turns his back. He has</p>
<p class=""line"">Swallowed the last of the dress...Oh, Sheep, Sheep,</p>
<p class=""line"">This is my undoing, that you have a thought</p>
<p class=""line"">And I <em>can</em> read it. Dear Monstrous Child, I would</p>
<p class=""line"">Nurse you if I could. But you are far too large,</p>
<p class=""line"">And I am far too old for such foolishness.</p>

<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Listen: there was a goat’s head hanging by ropes in a tree.</p>
<p class=""line"">All night it hung there and sang. And those who heard it</p>
<p class=""line"">Felt a hurt in their hearts and thought they were hearing</p>
<p class=""line"">The song of a night bird. They sat up in their beds, and then</p>
<p class=""line"">They lay back down again. In the night wind, the goat’s head</p>
<p class=""line"">Swayed back and forth, and from far off it shone faintly</p>
<p class=""line"">The way the moonlight shone on the train track miles away</p>
<p class=""line"">Beside which the goat’s headless body lay. Some boys</p>
<p class=""line"">Had hacked its head off. It was harder work than they had imagined.</p>
<p class=""line"">The goat cried like a man and struggled hard. But they</p>
<p class=""line"">Finished the job. They hung the bleeding head by the school</p>
<p class=""line"">And then ran off into the darkness that seems to hide everything.</p>
<p class=""line"">The head hung in the tree. The body lay by the tracks.</p>
<p class=""line"">The head called to the body. The body to the head.</p>
<p class=""line"">They missed each other. The missing grew large between them,</p>
<p class=""line"">Until it pulled the heart right out of the body, until</p>
<p class=""line"">The drawn heart flew toward the head, flew as a bird flies</p>
<p class=""line"">Back to its cage and the familiar perch from which it trills.</p>
<p class=""line"">Then the heart sang in the head, softly at first and then louder,</p>
<p class=""line"">Sang long and low until the morning light came up over</p>
<p class=""line"">The school and over the tree, and then the singing stopped…</p>
<p class=""line"">The goat had belonged to a small girl. She named</p>
<p class=""line"">The goat Broken Thorn Sweet Blackberry, named it after</p>
<p class=""line"">The night’s bush of stars, because the goat’s silky hair</p>
<p class=""line"">Was dark as well water, because it had eyes like wild fruit.</p>
<p class=""line"">The girl lived near a high railroad track. At night</p>
<p class=""line"">She heard the trains passing, the sweet sound of the train’s horn</p>
<p class=""line"">Pouring softly over her bed, and each morning she woke</p>
<p class=""line"">To give the bleating goat his pail of warm milk. She sang</p>
<p class=""line"">Him songs about girls with ropes and cooks in boats.</p>
<p class=""line"">She brushed him with a stiff brush. She dreamed daily</p>
<p class=""line"">That he grew bigger, and he did. She thought her dreaming</p>
<p class=""line"">Made it so. But one night the girl didn’t hear the train’s horn,</p>
<p class=""line"">And the next morning she woke to an empty yard. The goat</p>
<p class=""line"">Was gone. Everything looked strange. It was as if a storm</p>
<p class=""line"">Had passed through while she slept, wind and stones, rain</p>
<p class=""line"">Stripping the branches of fruit. She knew that someone</p>
<p class=""line"">Had stolen the goat and that he had come to harm. She called</p>
<p class=""line"">To him. All morning and into the afternoon, she called</p>
<p class=""line"">And called. She walked and walked. In her chest a bad feeling</p>
<p class=""line"">Like the feeling of the stones gouging the soft undersides</p>
<p class=""line"">Of her bare feet. Then somebody found the goat’s body</p>
<p class=""line"">By the high tracks, the flies already filling their soft bottles</p>
<p class=""line"">At the goat’s torn neck. Then somebody found the head</p>
<p class=""line"">Hanging in a tree by the school. They hurried to take</p>
<p class=""line"">These things away so that the girl would not see them.</p>
<p class=""line"">They hurried to raise money to buy the girl another goat.</p>
<p class=""line"">They hurried to find the boys who had done this, to hear</p>
<p class=""line"">Them say it was a joke, a joke, it was nothing but a joke…</p>
<p class=""line"">But listen: here is the point. The boys thought to have</p>
<p class=""line"">Their fun and be done with it. It was harder work than they</p>
<p class=""line"">Had imagined, this silly sacrifice, but they finished the job,</p>
<p class=""line"">Whistling as they washed their large hands in the dark.</p>
<p class=""line"">What they didn’t know was that the goat’s head was already</p>
<p class=""line"">Singing behind them in the tree. What they didn’t know</p>
<p class=""line"">Was that the goat’s head would go on singing, just for them,</p>
<p class=""line"">Long after the ropes were down, and that they would learn to listen,</p>
<p class=""line"">Pail after pail, stroke after patient stroke. They would</p>
<p class=""line"">Wake in the night thinking they heard the wind in the trees</p>
<p class=""line"">Or a night bird, but their hearts beating harder. There</p>
<p class=""line"">Would be a whistle, a hum, a high murmur, and, at last, a song,</p>
<p class=""line"">The low song a lost boy sings remembering his mother’s call.</p>
<p class=""line"">Not a cruel song, no, no, not cruel at all. This song</p>
<p class=""line"">Is sweet. It is sweet. The heart dies of this sweetness.</p>

Max Jacob's Leather Coat and the Possibility of Grief,Ray Gonzalez,"<p class=""line byline""><em>by <a href=""http://poetry.lib.uidaho.edu/index.php/poets/#gonzalez"">Ray Gonzalez</a></em></p>
<p></p>
<p align=justify>On the day the Gestapo came and took him away, the last three prose poems he was writing were left at the kitchen table along with his old leather coat that hung on the chair, until Jacob’s landlord entered the room and grabbed it. One can retrace the history of the coat and notice the silhouette of a man sitting at the kitchen table without the coat that accompanied him all over Paris. The last three poems he wrote in freedom were about the leather coat because the sheets were found two weeks later by the young woman who rented Jacob’s apartment. When she entered the kitchen for the first time, she picked up the pieces of paper, but did not know how to read, so she set the poems on the dirty table and went to inspect the other room. Max Jacob’s last three poems before he was taken away by the Nazis were finally read by the figure sitting at the table, alone and bent over, squinting at the tiny handwriting, his leather coat worn tightly on his shoulders.</p>

"The Lynching Postcard. Duluth, Minnesota",Ray Gonzalez,"<p class=""line byline""><em>by <a href=""http://poetry.lib.uidaho.edu/index.php/poets/#gonzalez"">Ray Gonzalez</a></em></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">There is a postcard in an antique shop in Duluth</p>
<p class=""line"">with a photograph of the infamous lynching of</p>
<p class=""line"">a black man carried out in the town in the 1930s.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">The owner was turned down by eBay when</p>
<p class=""line"">he wanted to sell it there. Tourists walk into</p>
<p class=""line"">his shop and stare at the lone card in the glass case.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">The owner says it is better to sell it</p>
<p class=""line"">than donate it to a museum where</p>
<p class=""line"">it would be locked away in a drawer.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Some people want it removed.</p>
<p class=""line"">Others snicker and stare, shake their heads</p>
<p class=""line"">and accept the fact this is “only Minnesota.”</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Each morning, the shop owner glances</p>
<p class=""line"">at the case to make sure the postcard is there.</p>
<p class=""line"">Thousands have bowed over the glass.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">At night, when the shop is closed,</p>
<p class=""line"">the postcard lies in the case, the body hanging</p>
<p class=""line"">in the cold moonlight from Lake Superior,</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">the shadow from the swinging body</p>
<p class=""line"">forming a shape that rises through</p>
<p class=""line"">the glass to darken the shop.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Over a dozen people have come across it.</p>
<p class=""line"">They don’t know the act of bending over the glass</p>
<p class=""line"">to study the dead body on the pole is forming</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">an invisible arc of light over time,</p>
<p class=""line"">a shadow where those who bow to look</p>
<p class=""line"">imitate the shape of a hanging tree.</p>

XLIX,John Gallaher,"<p class=""line byline""><em>by <a href=""http://poetry.lib.uidaho.edu/index.php/poets/#gallaher"">John Gallaher</a></em></p>
</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">The college mascot is visiting the elementary school. It’s</p>
<p class=""line"">celebrity reading day, and it strikes me as suddenly funny,</p>
<p class=""line"">as mascots are mute creatures best experienced</p>
<p class=""line"">from a distance. Last week the university president</p>
<p class=""line"">was the celebrity reader. He read a book called <em>T</em></p>
<p class=""line""><em>Is for Turkey</em>. I asked Robin if it was an autobiography.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">I love it when life gives us these little punch lines. Like the way</p>
<p class=""line"">“that’s what <em>she</em> said,” keeps making the rounds, which was once,</p>
<p class=""line"">apparently “Said the actress to the bishop,” which comes from</p>
<p class=""line"">Britain, and might date from Elizabethan times, or, the much better,</p>
<p class=""line"">to some at least, when someone says something with an “-er” ending</p>
<p class=""line"">to you, you can reply, “but you brought her.” Soccer? You</p>
<p class=""line"">brought her. Sucker? You get the drift. Hold a screw in your palm,</p>
<p class=""line"">and ask someone if they wanna screw. If someone is wearing something</p>
<p class=""line"">with a heart on it, you can say, “I see you’ve got a heart on.”</p>
<p class=""line"">(That one doesn’t work well on paper.)</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">One of the ones I’ve known for a long time, I picked up</p>
<p class=""line"">from a guy in high school, Vick Vanucci: pick up a leaf</p>
<p class=""line"">and then hand it to someone, saying, “leaf me alone.” A couple months</p>
<p class=""line"">after I heard him say that, I got to use a similar one on him. He was flipping</p>
<p class=""line"">my social studies book closed while I was trying to read (it was</p>
<p class=""line"">reading aloud day in social studies class), and writing “YOU ARE A</p>
<p class=""line"">DI_K” on the inside heal of my sneakers that were under my desk</p>
<p class=""line"">for gym class next period. I’d had enough. So I waited my chance</p>
<p class=""line"">and then hit him as hard as I could across the back of his trumpet playing hand</p>
<p class=""line"">with my gym lock. It was a dial combination lock</p>
<p class=""line"">with a big circular knob on the front. There was already swelling</p>
<p class=""line"">by the end of class. So then, next period, there we were</p>
<p class=""line"">in the gym. He does the whole arm-up-behind-my-back-smashing-my-faceinto-</p>
<p class=""line"">the-lockers thing. Ah, high school. He said, “Tell everybody</p>
<p class=""line"">you’re a dick!” And I replied, “OK, you’re a dick.”</p>
<p class=""line"">I sometimes think it was the greatest moment of my life.</p>

<p></p>
<p class=""line"">“Are you happy?” That’s a good place to start, or maybe,</p>
<p class=""line"">“Do you think you’re happy?” with its more negative</p>
<p class=""line"">tone. Sometimes you’re walking, sometimes falling. That’s part</p>
<p class=""line"">of the problem too, but not all of the problem. Flowers out the window</p>
<p class=""line"">or on the windowsill, and so someone brought flowers.</p>
<p class=""line"">We spend a long time interested in which way the car would</p>
<p class=""line"">best go in the driveway. Is that the beginning of an answer?</p>
<p class=""line"">Some way to say who we are?</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Well, it brings us up to now, at any rate, as the limitations</p>
<p class=""line"">of structure, which is the way we need for it to be. Invent some muses</p>
<p class=""line"">and invoke them, or save them for the yard, some animus</p>
<p class=""line"">to get us going. And what was it Michael said yesterday? That</p>
<p class=""line"">the committee to do all these good things has an agenda to do all these</p>
<p class=""line"">other things as well, that we decide are less good in our estimation,</p>
<p class=""line"">so then we have this difficulty. It just gets to you sometimes. We have</p>
<p class=""line"">a table of red apples and a table of green apples, and someone asks you</p>
<p class=""line"">about apples, but that’s too general, you think, as you’ve made</p>
<p class=""line"">several distinctions to get to this place of two tables, two colors.</p>
<p class=""line"">How can that be an answer to anything? Or we can play the forgetting game,</p>
<p class=""line"">how, for twenty years, my mother would answer for her forgetfulness</p>
<p class=""line"">by saying it was Old-Timer’s Disease, until she forgot that too.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">On the television, a truck passes left to right, in stereo. Outside,</p>
<p class=""line"">a garbage truck passes right to left. They intersect. And so the world continues</p>
<p class=""line"">around two corners. The table gets turned over, with several people</p>
<p class=""line"">standing around seemingly not sure of what comes next. Look at them</p>
<p class=""line"">politely as you can, they’re beginners too. And they say the right question</p>
<p class=""line"">is far more difficult to get to than the right answer. It sounds good,</p>
<p class=""line"">anyway, in the way other people’s lives are a form of distance, something</p>
<p class=""line"">you can look at, like landscape, until your own starts to look that way</p>
<p class=""line"">as well. Looking back at the alternatives, we never had children</p>
<p class=""line"">or we had more children. And what were their names? As the living room parts</p>
<p class=""line"">into halls and ridges, where we spend the afternoon imagining a plant,</p>
<p class=""line"">a filing cabinet or two . . . because some of these questions</p>
<p class=""line"">you have with others, and some you have only with yourself.</p>

XVI,John Gallaher,"<p class=""line byline""><em>by <a href=""http://poetry.lib.uidaho.edu/index.php/poets/#gallaher"">John Gallaher</a></em></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">The early bird might get the worm, but the early person</p>
<p class=""line"">mostly just has to sit around and wait for everyone else to show up.</p>
<p class=""line"">So much for pithy ideas about personal betterment. People</p>
<p class=""line"">have always been like this, I’m certain, waking up one day</p>
<p class=""line"">feeling a little different (6% Neanderthal, maybe), and then wondering</p>
<p class=""line"">if this means it’s the end of something or the beginning of something.</p>
<p class=""line"">I’m better now, this morning, not realizing I’d been worse,</p>
<p class=""line"">a light cold. So maybe this is the worse to some future better? The idea</p>
<p class=""line"">of becoming enters, and so then we’re all becoming.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">In the movie <em>The In-Laws</em>, there’s this scene where the fathers of the bride</p>
<p class=""line"">and groom are running through gunfire at an airport, and the</p>
<p class=""line"">secret-agent dad calls out to the common-man dad, “Serpentine!</p>
<p class=""line"">Serpentine!” while zigzagging. For some reason that’s stuck with me more</p>
<p class=""line"">than most anything else from my youth. It felt like good advice,</p>
<p class=""line"">as the unknown is merciless, and so of course, the common-man dad</p>
<p class=""line"">runs back to his starting place and begins again, running through the bullets</p>
<p class=""line"">a second time, getting it right. Repetition is how we learn things,</p>
<p class=""line"">as Natalie and Eliot both are asking me for the same story over and over,</p>
<p class=""line"">until it starts to feel to me as if there’s no other story than this one.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">When did I become what I’ve become, then, as it always seems</p>
<p class=""line"">nothing’s changing? “Life is what happens to you while you’re busy</p>
<p class=""line"">making other plans,” as John Lennon had it, and I stood</p>
<p class=""line"">in front of the Dakota in the cold, on the anniversary of his murder.</p>
<p class=""line"">I thought I was paying attention. Maybe I should have paid something else</p>
<p class=""line"">then. Some more subtle division, as three years after writing this</p>
<p class=""line"">I’m looking back at it: it’s 2012 now, we’ve moved across town, after</p>
<p class=""line"">our neighbor, Matt, tried to corner Robin in our basement while I</p>
<p class=""line"">was out of town. There’s a question in that, and the answer comes</p>
<p class=""line"">when you stop asking the question. We sit around, and windows</p>
<p class=""line"">are what we talk about, because we’re surrounded by windows. Life’s</p>
<p class=""line"">a game of Hide & Seek, they say, and maybe you’ll be a really good hider.</p>

<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<em>all the way home</em></p> 
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">We cared for her and watched the furious streaks,</p>
<p class=""line"">the flesh gone yellow, gray-green, then black,</p>
<p class=""line"">the darkness creeping from toe to toe, from toe to arch,</p>
<p class=""line"">till through the ruptured skin we could see her graying</p>
<p class=""line"">muscle. We could see her bones. But we turned</p>
<p class=""line"">her every hour, as the nurses directed, turned her</p>
<p class=""line"">gingerly so as not to lose the softened flesh.</p>
<p class=""line"">We lifted the ruined foot, wrapped in a paper layer,</p>
<p class=""line"">and eased it into a garbage bag to catch its leaking.</p>
<p class=""line"">That the bag was airless, a plastic kiln for already</p>
<p class=""line"">burning flesh, we did not consider, doing the best</p>
<p class=""line"">we could, doing what the nurses told us, giving</p>
<p class=""line"">her codeine with sips of water, watching</p>
<p class=""line"">as her urine darkened. But it didn’t matter.</p> 
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">She slept mostly, moaning when we lifted her head</p>
<p class=""line"">to press a cup against her lips, moaning as we turned</p>
<p class=""line"">her. Each day, the nurse begged her family: <em>Reconsider,</em></p>
<p class=""line""><em>please reconsider</em>. How many days? How many hours?</p>
<p class=""line"">Enough for the foot to fall from the ankle, for the Achilles’</p>
<p class=""line"">string to slacken, rotted through, for us to reel away,</p>
<p class=""line"">dizzied by wretchedness, afraid that we would watch</p>
<p class=""line"">the gangrenous blackening from ankle to calf.</p>
<p class=""line"">But at last the nurse called enough times. The son’s</p>
<p class=""line"">wife came. She went in and hurried out, saying <em>Oh</em>.</p>
<p class=""line""><em>Oh, we didn’t know</em>. And we hated them.</p>

<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Dust, stillness, the stench of raw earth,</p>
<p class=""line"">each year, this same solemnity&mdash;</p>
<p class=""line"">lifting the trapdoor to take the rungs</p>
<p class=""line"">down and down into a room of sand</p>
<p class=""line"">in search of a box that held nothing.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Nothing? A cardboard box tied by twine,</p>
<p class=""line"">storage for two skirts, a cotton blouse,</p>
<p class=""line"">a tea-colored slip, a lady’s handkerchief</p>
<p class=""line"">stitched with purple floss by hands</p>
<p class=""line"">she had never touched, though she knew</p>
<p class=""line"">the pockets their fingers had reached into,</p>
<p class=""line"">and the hems they had raised and pushed aside.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Heirlooms washed and folded over a garden fence,</p>
<p class=""line"">left for the sun to dry and the heat</p>
<p class=""line"">to billow full again, as clothes will always</p>
<p class=""line"">seek dimension. See&mdash;she was a short woman</p>
<p class=""line"">and wide-hipped. She sewed. On Sundays</p>
<p class=""line"">she wore a blue cotton blouse with velvet panels.</p>
<p class=""line"">Her hems swished and smelled of red sand.</p>
<p class=""line"">Nothing more. And the one who raised</p>
<p class=""line"">the trapdoor and lifted the box asks, asks,</p>
<p class=""line"">and asks, but they know nothing more.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Slip, skirts, blouse, hanky, she brings</p>
<p class=""line"">them in, smooths the folds into fresh creases,</p>
<p class=""line"">mummies each piece into sheet or pillow sham,</p>
<p class=""line"">and restores them in a cardboard box</p>
<p class=""line"">to sand, to darkness and cool unmoving air.</p>
<p class=""line"">Will anyone save the cloth-skin</p>

<p class=""line"">Will anyone wash away its darkness?</p>

Shaking the Grass,Janice N. Harrington,"<p class=""line byline""><em>by <a href=""http://poetry.lib.uidaho.edu/index.php/poets/#harrington"">Janice N. Harrington</a></em></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Evening, and all my ghosts come back to me</p>
<p class=""line"">like red banty hens to catalpa limbs</p>
<p class=""line"">and chicken-wired hutches, clucking, clucking,</p>
<p class=""line"">and falling, at last, into their head-under-wing sleep.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">I think about the field of grass I lay in once,</p>
<p class=""line"">between Omaha and Lincoln. It was summer, I think.</p>
<p class=""line"">The air smelled green, and wands of windy green, a-sway,</p>
<p class=""line"">a-sway, swayed over me. I lay on green sod</p>
<p class=""line"">like a prairie snake letting the sun warm me.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">What does a girl think about alone</p>
<p class=""line"">in a field of grass, beneath a sky as bright</p>
<p class=""line"">as an Easter dress, beneath a green wind?</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Maybe I have not shaken the grass.</p>
<p class=""line"">All is vanity.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Maybe I never rose from that green field.</p>
<p class=""line"">All is vanity.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Maybe I did no more than swallow deep, deep breaths</p>
<p class=""line"">and spill them out into story: all is vanity.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Maybe I listened to the wind sighing and shivered,</p>
<p class=""line"">spinning, awhirl amidst the bluestem</p>
<p class=""line"">and green lashes: O my beloved! O my beloved!</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">I lay in a field of grass once, and then went on.</p>

They Are World Travelers,Christopher Kennedy,"<p class=""line byline""><em>by <a href=""http://poetry.lib.uidaho.edu/index.php/poets/#kennedy"">Christopher Kennedy</a></em></p>
<p></p>
<p align=justify>I’m sick of them arriving on the backs of rogue elephants, and I tire of their stories of aborigines. I burrow in my basement while they traverse oceans. When I visit them, I sit in chairs made of rare bamboo and mispronounce, while they speak fluent Cantonese, a rare dialect, spoken only by a cohort of twenty on a remote, exotic plateau that can only be reached on foot.</p> 
<p></p>
<p align=justify>Dishwashers are a type of marsupial, I’ve decided. So I carry several photographs of my own to show at their dinner parties. They feign interest and project their slides of an ancient fertility ritual, involving the pregnant bellies of black widow spiders they say improved their sex lives yet again.</p> 
<p></p>
<p align=justify>Their papaya sorbet tastes like dung, but I’m forced to smile and watch them hula across the living room in authentic Hawaiian garb. If only their skin were a different shade of umber; if only I weren’t reduced to tears by the stories told by their bodies’ sway and the graceful movement of their pertinacious, birdlike hands.</p>

The Fact Remains,Christopher Kennedy,"<p class=""line byline""><em>by <a href=""http://poetry.lib.uidaho.edu/index.php/poets/#kennedy"">Christopher Kennedy</a></em></p>
<p></p>
<p align=justify>I’m heavier than some animals, lighter than others. Also, I’m more threatening than most animals, less threatening than a few; faster than some, slower than most. I don’t bite, though, unless provoked by desire. What I want to say is: I still measure distance in years. And swans mate for life. At least that’s what I believe. I want a pair of <em>somethings</em> to refer to when I’m trying to make a point. The point is this: I’m an animal who knows where he stands among other animals. I can outrun a snail and threaten a housefly. I can conquer an anthill and mate for life. But the fact remains: My favorite dog has bitten the entire neighborhood. <em>Here, boy,</em> I say, but he ignores me, intent on running down another frightened child on a bicycle. He’s mangy, too. His collar’s too tight, and there’s no quenching his thirst. Raw meat’s the answer, but I’m too lazy to go to the store. This is the story of a boy and his dog. Though as far as I can tell, the dog ran off a long time ago.</p>

The Unimaginable World,Christopher Kennedy,"<p class=""line byline""><em>by <a href=""http://poetry.lib.uidaho.edu/index.php/poets/#kennedy"">Christopher Kennedy</a></em></p>
<p></p>
<p align=justify>If I stab you with the crescent moon, you can’t be mad at me. You can be surprised, but not angry. No one can admonish me for using the moon as a weapon. In the unimaginable world, a moon stabbing is perfectly acceptable. I know this type of romance takes patience. I’m busy in so many realms, I’m not always available. I sleep with my eyes open so I can keep you amused.</p> 
<p></p>
<p align=justify>If I smother you with a rain cloud, it’s just another illusion. Don’t hold it against me. None of it’s real. I’m throwing stars at you, but you don’t even feel it. I’ve crushed you three times today with a mountain, and you go on as if nothing happened. I rose from the dead just to see what’s for dinner. I slipped though the silk membrane of time so you wouldn’t have to sleep alone tonight. I’m body and blood. I’m the good with the bad. I’m not what you think when you think you’re thinking about love.</p>

Dream of a Large Lady,Carolyn Kizer,"<p class=""line byline""><em>by <a href=""http://poetry.lib.uidaho.edu/index.php/poets/#kizer"">Carolyn Kizer</a></em></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">The large lady laboriously climbs</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;down the ladder from a gun emplacement.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">She had gone up to contemplate</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;the blue view</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;and to damage the gun.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">She has done neither</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;for the view was a baize haze</p>
<p class=""line"">and the rooted gun immovable in stone.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;So she climbs down the shaky ladder</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;with a few rungs missing</p>
<p class=""line"">carrying her mostly uneaten</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;picnic lunch</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">of which she has consumed a single</p>

<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;leaving the shell</p>
<p class=""line"">not as litter but as symbolism</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;on the sullen gun</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;in its grey rotunda.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">At the foot of the ladder she finds sand;</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;and one brown, shuttered house</p>
<p class=""line"">from which another lady</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;stares.</p>

<p class=""line"">matching her orange hair</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;in a bun.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">The large lady perforates along the beach</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;on her high-heeled pumps</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;by the water’s verge,</p>
<p class=""line"">as a large, pale water-bird might do.</p>

<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;When she reaches her own cottage</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;near the bay,</p>
<p class=""line"">she finds a letter from the strange orange lady</p>

<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;lying on the table:</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">“I am an admirer of your poesy,</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;so I am baking you a fresh peach pie,”</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;the nice note reads.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">“Do come to my house near the bay,”</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;she speaks in her head,</p>

<p></p>
<p class=""line"">“We will sit here quietly, in twlilght,</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;and drink a cup of carefully brewed tea.”</p>

<p></p>
<p class=""line"">first, I tell you who I am:</p>
<p class=""line"">shadowed, reflective, small,</p>
<p class=""line"">pool in an unknown glade.</p>
<p class=""line"">It is easy to be a poet,</p>
<p class=""line"">brim with transparent water.</p>
<p class=""line"">In autumn, the leaves blow down</p>
<p class=""line"">over the ruffled surface,</p>
<p class=""line"">sink to rest, then resume their cycle.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">In the second stanza, you laugh,</p>
<p class=""line"">skipping pebbles across my surface</p>
<p class=""line"">charmed by the spreading circles.</p>
<p class=""line"">In the trees’ perpetual twilight</p>
<p class=""line"">you are alone with the poet.</p>
<p class=""line"">Gently, you shake your head.</p>
<p class=""line"">You know me as turbulent ocean</p>
<p class=""line"">clouded with thunder and drama.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">In the third stanza, I die.</p>
<p class=""line"">Still, I insist on composing</p>
<p class=""line"">as my throes go on and on.</p>
<p class=""line"">I clench the pen in my teeth</p>
<p class=""line"">making those furious scratches</p>
<p class=""line"">that you will see, much later,</p>
<p class=""line"">as graceful calligraphy:</p>
<p class=""line"">drift of sails that sketch my horizon.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">My hands, in the fourth stanza,</p>
<p class=""line"">with the agonized clutch of the dying,</p>
<p class=""line"">draw your hand beneath the covers.</p>
<p class=""line"">I beg you to travel my body</p>
<p class=""line"">till you find the forest glade.</p>
<p class=""line"">Then your hand, like a leaf in autumn,</p>
<p class=""line"">is pulled into the pool.</p>
<p class=""line"">The rest of you doesn’t believe it.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">The fifth stanza begins</p>
<p class=""line"">with water, and quiet laughter.</p>
<p class=""line"">Then I die. I really die.</p>
<p class=""line"">You pick up this piece of paper</p>
<p class=""line"">You read it aloud and explain me,</p>
<p class=""line"">my profile cast in prose.</p>
<p class=""line"">It drops from your hand like a leaf.</p>
<p class=""line"">This is all part of the cycle.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Then, in the final stanza,</p>
<p class=""line"">I tell you who I am.</p>

<p class=""line"">The vandals are dreaming, wolves are dreaming,</p>
<p class=""line"">The horses are staked to their deaths.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">In the poem of the vandals dreaming</p>
<p class=""line"">A word bites through a lip,</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Drawing blood. (The poem is in ruins.)</p>
<p class=""line"">The vandals dream their arms unseen,</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Dream themselves buried in the belly</p>
<p class=""line"">Of the birthing mare, as a foal is</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Torn to life. (The poem is banal</p>
<p class=""line"">As the barn is bloody.)</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">And you and I, and you and I, we steal</p>
<p class=""line"">Each other’s blankets, wrap ourselves</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">In darkness, wind, in anything</p>
<p class=""line"">The night will let us, to feel safe.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Do you feel safe? (Soft,</p>
<p class=""line"">The vandals sleep.) Because a word</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Is a dream of its meaning, you and I</p>
<p class=""line"">Must dream the vandals dreaming:</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Soft, the horses nicker in the barn.</p>

<p class=""line"">but ready anyway, the angle of</p>
<p class=""line"">her teen years practiced every night&mdash;</p>

<p class=""line"">And oh, how I want Mama to say yes,</p>

<p class=""line"">three weeks away, and an hour’s</p>
<p class=""line"">bumpy bus ride in the summer rain,</p>

<p class=""line"">wending down the coastal highway:</p>
<p class=""line"">she’ll listen to her Mama.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Me? I’ll listen to the rain</p>

<p class=""line"">and try on</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">word after word after word,</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">always getting wrong the color of those rose hips</p>
<p class=""line"">along the muddy ditch, a blurred swath of</p>
<p class=""line"">pink and green by the thrift store sign,</p>

<p class=""line"">wedged in the present</p>

The Cat,Alan Michael Parker,"<p class=""line byline""><em>by <a href=""http://poetry.lib.uidaho.edu/index.php/poets/#parker"">Alan Michael Parker</a></em></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">I have been trying to understand</p>
<p class=""line"">whether this life is what we burnish for the next.</p>
<p class=""line"">Or will we be undone.</p>
<p class=""line"">Last week a feral kitten found me, and now,</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">mottled with ringworm,</p>
<p class=""line"">she moans in quarantine in my kitchen</p>
<p class=""line"">and hugs a catnip mouse made of felt,</p>
<p class=""line"">A scrawny, contagious cat in a kennel&mdash;</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">she could be my heart.</p>
<p class=""line"">Which is to say: <em>yowl, darkness, prison.</em></p>
<p class=""line"">Which is to say: <em>aria, nocturne, home.</em></p>
<p class=""line"">Which is to say: <em>pushing words around,</em></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">the in-box and the out.</p>
<p class=""line"">I named the cat Simone de Beauvoir.</p>
<p class=""line"">Is that the name of my heart?</p>
<p class=""line"">I don’t even like cats,</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">which she pretends not to know.</p>
<p class=""line"">What does my heart pretend not to know?</p>
<p class=""line"">Working at love</p>
<p class=""line"">means abandoning the burnishing.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">When I first saw her almost dead in the street,</p>
<p class=""line"">I sat down and waited.</p>
<p class=""line"">She circled me, coming closer,</p>
<p class=""line"">until I was stupid and put out my hand.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">The two of us in the middle of the street.</p>
<p class=""line"">How could she think I know anything,</p>
<p class=""line"">sitting in the middle of a street?</p>
<p class=""line"">Now near the end of her sentence</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">she scratches the plastic kennel to get out.</p>
<p class=""line"">What could she know?</p>
<p class=""line"">Which is to say: <em>need.</em></p>
<p class=""line"">Which is to say: <em>fear.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">So many poems about the next life.</p>
<p class=""line"">To make the poem itself a moral act.</p>
<p class=""line"">Which is to say: <em>heaven.</em></p>
<p class=""line"">Which is to say: <em>a larger room.</em></p>

<p class=""line"">Twilight might be called</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;a gray scarf pulled over your lover’s eyes.</p>
<p class=""line"">And the bicyclist’s body</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;cutting swiftly through it</p>

<p class=""line"">is a beautifully composed semaphore,</p>

<p class=""line"">in a set of signal lights</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;at the end of a darkening runway:</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">two orange sticks crossed, then waving,</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;motioning inward.</p>
<p class=""line"">I should be telling you about fireflies,</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;the containment of light, how we work</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">to bring it closer to us, into our bodies,</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;into a glass jar with a screw-on lid</p>
<p class=""line"">where it can shine and reverberate</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;in the ever-thinning air. Instead</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">I think of my fifth summer,</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;the day I lost one shoe</p>
<p class=""line"">over the side of a sailboat,</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;its sinking away from me</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">into the untreadable dark.</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The soul is composed</p>
<p class=""line"">of infinite planets sucked into black holes</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;and what comes out the other side&mdash;</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">light or its golden shadow&mdash;is each our own.</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Like those fishing boats</p>
<p class=""line"">that ride out to the world’s curve each evening,</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;their string of bobbing lamps</p>
<p></p>

<p class=""line"">It’s summer. Eighty-five degrees.</p>
<p class=""line"">We’ve spent all day on a blanket</p>
<p class=""line"">in the high grass of an abandoned</p>
<p class=""line"">cemetery. The backs of my thighs</p>
<p class=""line"">are sunburned and tomorrow I’ll shiver</p>
<p class=""line"">as the heat pours out of my skin.</p>
<p class=""line"">Earlier, when I climbed onto you</p>
<p class=""line"">for the second time, I could see</p>
<p class=""line"">a row of headstones through the trees.</p>
<p class=""line"">And when I rocked over you</p>
<p class=""line"">their round and rain-worn scalps</p>
<p class=""line"">rose into my line of sight until</p>
<p class=""line"">I could imagine the bodies beneath them</p>
<p class=""line"">propped up, watching us make love.</p>
<p class=""line"">Each one of their wide skulls silently</p>
<p class=""line"">smiled as if remembering something</p>
<p class=""line"">sweet and fleeting, and not wanting</p>
<p class=""line"">to tell me so. I needed to explain to them then</p>
<p class=""line"">that my body has been a bell</p>
<p class=""line"">that’s waited years to be rung by you.</p>
<p class=""line"">That the cartilage grinding in my hip sockets</p>
<p class=""line"">when I move against you makes a dust</p>
<p class=""line"">finer than the finest semolina flour</p>
<p class=""line"">and I pay it out from my body willingly.</p>
<p class=""line"">That finally coming to love you</p>
<p class=""line"">has been a hard-earned pleasure,</p>
<p class=""line"">so that every time you enter me</p>
<p class=""line"">I want to cry out, <em>Bury me,</em></p>

<p class=""line"">The weather came in just as I left town, a farewell show</p>
<p class=""line"">over the hood of the car. There has to be a way</p>
<p class=""line"">to put the beauty inside, to carry it along: snow flurries</p>
<p class=""line"">freckling my belly, cedar fence post ribs</p>
<p class=""line"">expanding with each breath. But you want to know</p>
<p class=""line"">what to do with the dead cow we saw in the winter pasture,</p>
<p class=""line"">where to hide the old mill pouring her bitter steam&mdash;</p>
<p class=""line"">All those landmarks that hold a body under, pin it down,</p>
<p class=""line"">belong in narrow little books with loose spines</p>
<p class=""line"">where folded ferns fall out moth-riddled,</p>
<p class=""line"">worm-worn pages pinpricked through with light.</p>
<p class=""line"">I couldn’t be the crutch of cloudless days against</p>
<p class=""line"">your dog-eared sadnesses. But maybe I was wrong</p>
<p class=""line"">to think I understood despair’s whittling hand any better</p>
<p class=""line"">than you did, now walking among all that beauty I left behind.</p>

<p class=""line"">of isolation, and if I’m anything,</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">I’m modern. That must be why missing</p>

Birthday Poem,Keetje Kuipers,"<p class=""line byline""><em>by <a href=""http://poetry.lib.uidaho.edu/index.php/poets/#kuipers"">Keetje Kuipers</a></em></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">My earliest memory is someone else’s.</p>
<p class=""line"">A few years later, I eat all the yellow</p>
<p class=""line"">flowers off the clover, the first of 1000</p>
<p class=""line"">small secrets I’ll forget. The little boys</p>
<p class=""line"">are my neighbors and I spend each</p>
<p class=""line"">afternoon making us a home. Soon</p>
<p class=""line"">my legs grow so long they are other</p>
<p class=""line"">than myself. More parts follow,</p>
<p class=""line"">scaffolding becomes necessary.</p>
<p class=""line"">The marching band plays songs I know</p>
<p class=""line"">by heart; I mean that I memorize all</p>
<p class=""line"">the words. Each time I get on a plane,</p>
<p class=""line"">I’m someone new, until I’m so good</p>
<p class=""line"">I don’t need to fly to transform.</p>
<p class=""line"">When my parents are suddenly</p>
<p class=""line"">more tired than they’ve ever been,</p>
<p class=""line"">I take over the farm, the spoonfeeding.</p>
<p class=""line"">One minute I’m becoming</p>
<p class=""line"">myself, the next I’m forgetting how.</p>

<p class=""line"">Someone has been painting</p>
<p class=""line"">NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE</p>
<p class=""line"">across the backs of bus benches,</p>
<p class=""line"">blotting out the advertisements beneath</p>
<p class=""line"">with green so the strong silver letters</p>
<p class=""line"">appear clearly at corners,</p>
<p class=""line"">in front of taco stands</p>
<p class=""line"">and hardware stores.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Whoever did this</p>
<p class=""line"">must have done it in the dark,</p>
<p class=""line"">clanging paint cans block to block</p>
<p class=""line"">or a couple of sprays&mdash;</p>
<p class=""line"">they must have really</p>
<p class=""line"">wanted to do it.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Among the many distasteful graffiti on earth</p>
<p class=""line"">this line seems somehow honorable.</p>
<p class=""line"">It wants to help us.</p>
<p class=""line"">It could belong to anyone,</p>
<p class=""line"">Latinas, Arabs, Jews,</p>
<p class=""line"">priests, glue sniffers.</p>
<p class=""line"">Mostly I wonder about</p>
<p class=""line"">what happened or didn't happen</p>
<p class=""line"">in the painter's life</p>
<p class=""line"">to give her this line.</p>
<p class=""line"">I don't wonder about the person</p>
<p class=""line"">who painted HIV under the STOPs</p>
<p class=""line"">on the stop signs in the same way.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Did some miracle startle</p>
<p class=""line"">the painter into action</p>
<p class=""line"">or is she waiting and hoping?</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Does she ride the bus with her face</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;pressed to the window looking</p>
<p class=""line"">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;for her own message?</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">In her first home each book had a light around it.</p>
<p class=""line"">The voices of distant countries</p>
<p class=""line"">floated in through open windows,</p>
<p class=""line"">entering her soup and her mirror.</p>
<p class=""line"">They slept with her in the same thick bed.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Someday she would go there.</p>
<p class=""line"">Her voice, among all those voices.</p>
<p class=""line"">In Iraq a book never had one owner&mdash;it had ten.</p>
<p class=""line"">Lucky books, to be held often</p>
<p class=""line"">and gently, by so many hands.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Later in American libraries she felt sad</p>
<p class=""line"">for books no one ever checked out.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">She lived in a country house beside a pond</p>
<p class=""line"">and kept ducks, two male, one female.</p>
<p class=""line"">She worried over the difficult relations</p>
<p class=""line"">of triangles. One of the ducks</p>
<p class=""line"">often seemed depressed.</p>
<p class=""line"">But not the same one.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">During the war between her two countries</p>
<p class=""line"">she watched the ducks more than usual.</p>
<p class=""line"">She stayed quiet with the ducks.</p>
<p class=""line"">Some days they huddled among reeds</p>
<p class=""line"">or floated together.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">She could not call her family in Basra</p>
<p class=""line"">which had grown farther away than ever</p>
<p class=""line"">nor could they call her. For nearly a year</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">she would not know who was alive,</p>
<p class=""line"">who was dead.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">The ducks were building a nest.</p>

<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Once when my father was a boy</p>
<p class=""line"">a stone hit him on the head.</p>
<p class=""line"">Hair would never grow there.</p>
<p class=""line"">Our fingers found the tender spot</p>
<p class=""line"">and its riddle: the boy who has fallen</p>
<p class=""line"">stands up. A bucket of pears</p>
<p class=""line"">in his mother's doorwaywelcomes him home.</p>
<p class=""line"">The pears are not crying.</p>
<p class=""line"">Later his friend who threw the stone</p>
<p class=""line"">says he was aiming at a bird.</p>
<p class=""line"">And my father starts growing wings.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Each carries a tender spot:</p>
<p class=""line"">something our lives forgot to give us.</p>
<p class=""line"">A man builds a house and says,</p>
<p class=""line"">""I am native now.""</p>
<p class=""line"">A woman speaks to a tree in place</p>
<p class=""line"">of her son. And olives come.</p>
<p class=""line"">A child's poem says,</p>
<p class=""line"">""I don't like wars,</p>
<p class=""line"">they end up with monuments.""</p>
<p class=""line"">He's painting a bird with wings</p>
<p class=""line"">wide enough to cover two roofs at once.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Why are we so monumentally slow?</p>
<p class=""line"">Soldiers stalk a pharmacy:</p>
<p class=""line"">big guns, little pills.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">If you tilt your head just slightly</p>
<p class=""line"">it’s ridiculous.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">There’s a place in my brain</p>
<p class=""line"">where hate won’t grow.</p>
<p class=""line"">I touch its riddle: wind, and seeds.</p>
<p class=""line"">Something pokes us as we sleep.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">It’s late but everything comes next.</p>

<p class=""line"">No one should hold that against you.</p>
<p class=""line"">It’s a means of survival.</p>
<p class=""line"">Sometimes I thought my best talent was</p>
<p class=""line"">taking a skinny story, adding wings and a tail.</p>
<p class=""line"">Dressing it in a woolen Bedouin cloak</p>
<p class=""line"">with stitching around the edges.</p>
<p class=""line"">Putting a headdress on it.</p>
<p class=""line"">Making a better picture.</p>
<p class=""line"">Your mother got mad at me sometimes</p>
<p class=""line"">for telling a story differently but it wasn’t a lie,</p>
<p class=""line"">just a story in different clothes</p>
<p class=""line"">with other things emphasized.</p>
<p class=""line"">My own mother dressed up stories for 106 years</p>
<p class=""line"">till that last winter she rode in her bed</p>
<p class=""line"">like a boat, sitting up to sleep.</p>
<p class=""line"">Maybe it’s our duty to be shaped</p>
<p class=""line"">a hundred times by the same stories.</p>
<p class=""line"">We think we’re telling them</p>
<p class=""line"">but really they’re keeping us alive,</p>
<p class=""line"">memory oxygen breathed out and in.</p>

<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Professor Nordhaus assigned me</p>
<p class=""line"">Galway Kinnell’s “The Hen Flower,” section 2</p>
<p class=""line"">of <em>The Book of Nightmares</em>, instead of section 3,</p>
<p class=""line"">“The Shoes of Wandering.”</p>
<p class=""line"">Who wouldn’t rather go with Galway</p>
<p class=""line"">to The Salvation Army to try on “these shoes strangers</p>
<p class=""line"">have died from”? But instead, I got the hens,</p>
<p class=""line"">unable to understand the ax or the eggs,</p>
<p class=""line"">and me, not getting why it was the hen</p>
<p class=""line"">who helped Galway know</p>
<p class=""line"">how little he knew, how we sleep on the feathers</p>
<p class=""line"">of hens, how these feathers are all that lie</p>
<p class=""line"">between us and darkness.</p>
<p class=""line"">How hard it must have been to write</p>
<p class=""line"">“Listen, Kinnell,” and then to stop writing and listen</p>
<p class=""line"">to the hens in their sawdust beds.</p>
<p class=""line"">How hard it was to read and then go back</p>
<p class=""line"">to my room in Grace’s house where she let me stay</p>
<p class=""line"">for free while I went to school</p>
<p class=""line"">so I could learn again and again that everything</p>
<p class=""line"">dies, even the poem, even Galway</p>
<p class=""line"">who died this week and brought me back</p>
<p class=""line"">to that classroom where I sat behind</p>
<p class=""line"">a dark-haired girl named Mona.</p>
<p class=""line"">She only spoke once in class, the day we discussed</p>
<p class=""line"">a poem called “Breasts.” I learned then that she wasn’t</p>
<p class=""line"">shy, she just didn’t care much for shoes</p>
<p class=""line"">or hens, but breasts she liked, she kept almost</p>
<p class=""line"">cupping her own under her sweater as she talked</p>
<p class=""line"">about the poem until I thought she was going</p>
<p class=""line"">to actually show them. Which is where I think</p>
<p class=""line"">the poem was going.</p>

<p class=""line"">The air conditioner is dripping</p>
<p class=""line"">down the peeling paint, and the bathroom</p>
<p class=""line"">is full of poisoned bees staring at themselves</p>
<p class=""line"">in the mirror before they die,</p>
<p class=""line"">and all I want to do is drive, the radio a river</p>
<p class=""line"">of summers, everything I’ve lost</p>
<p class=""line"">flashing in its current.</p>
<p class=""line"">The car is blowing cool air over my skin</p>
<p class=""line"">and my arms are bare and freckled</p>
<p class=""line"">and they still look like my young arms,</p>
<p class=""line"">the ones I stared at in the sunlight</p>
<p class=""line"">on the front steps of my first house,</p>
<p class=""line"">thinking <em>These are mine</em>.</p>
<p class=""line"">No years in the skin, the years</p>
<p class=""line"">my friend from college keeps talking about</p>
<p class=""line"">when I meet her for breakfast.</p>
<p class=""line"">She orders eggs and then apologizes</p>
<p class=""line"">because she remembers how much</p>
<p class=""line"">I don’t like them, even though</p>
<p class=""line"">it’s been twenty years since she left</p>
<p class=""line"">her pink coat in the front closet</p>
<p class=""line"">and then called from Red Deer to ask me</p>
<p class=""line"">to send it. It was too soon, we needed</p>
<p class=""line"">more time to slide under. But I went</p>
<p class=""line"">to the closet and took the coat off the hanger.</p>
<p class=""line"">It had fake fur and little suede triangles,</p>
<p class=""line"">and I folded it and packed it in a box.</p>
<p class=""line"">My friend sips her coffee. Even back then</p>
<p class=""line"">she could let a pause fall like a shaft</p>
<p class=""line"">of light. But when I poured too much</p>
<p class=""line"">rum in my coke night after night,</p>
<p class=""line"">she poured some of it back, and through</p>
<p class=""line"">the thin walls of our house I sometimes</p>
<p class=""line"">heard her crying. She doesn’t finish</p>
<p class=""line"">her eggs and they sit between us</p>
<p class=""line"">on the table. Soon we will have to go</p>
<p class=""line"">back outside, into July.</p>

<p></p>
<p class=""line"">The scar on my arm is thin like the skin</p>
<p class=""line"">of a fruit close to splitting.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">It marks my birth as before ’72,</p>
<p class=""line"">before the end of smallpox but after polio,</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">after the wheelchairs and the iron lungs,</p>
<p class=""line"">the radios crackling with war.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">If you were born then, you remember</p>
<p class=""line"">taking your Halloween candy</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">to the fire station to have it checked</p>
<p class=""line"">for razor blades. You were a gypsy</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">because that was still okay.</p>
<p class=""line"">Maybe there was one black girl</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">in your class like Martha Washington</p>
<p class=""line"">who brought upside-down clown cones</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">for her birthday and then moved away.</p>
<p class=""line"">You watched the Challenger blow up</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">on the news again and again.</p>
<p class=""line"">I was there in my boots and eyeliner,</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">waiting by the wall until a boy</p>
<p class=""line"">asked me to dance. His mouth was a shock</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">of salt. I flicked my name off like ash</p>
<p class=""line"">from my cigarette. I loved how the tip</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">flamed, like the squares of coal</p>
<p class=""line"">in our furnace. Maybe you remember</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">my father. He was thin and transparent</p>
<p class=""line"">like the place where the needle went through.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">Maybe I can peel it off, the dead skin</p>
<p class=""line"">from a burn, the kind we got back then,</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""line"">before sunscreen, when we just took off</p>
<p class=""line"">our clothes and got in.</p>
