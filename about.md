# About Poem Select

[Vandal Poem of the Day](http://poetry.lib.uidaho.edu) (VPOD) is a public poetry project, which brings relevant contemporary poetry to the University of Idaho and the broader Idaho community. A new poem is published on the website every day during the academic year.

This site uses VPOD poetry as raw data for exploration of [Natural Language Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing).
The text of each poem was processed using [Watson Natural Language Understanding](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/natural-language-understanding.html) API providing a variety of metrics to play with.
